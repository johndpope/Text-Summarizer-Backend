VGeneral Public Utilities Corp  said its board declared a dividend of 15 cts per share on  common stock, its first dividend since it omitted payment in  February 1980 as a result of the Three Mile Island nuclear  accident in 1979.      The company said it was able to declare the dividend due to  progress in the cleanup of Three Mile Island Unit Two.      A company spokesman said GPU expects to continue declaring  dividends on a quarterly basis, with the rate depending on the  progress of the cleanup and on other company operations.      GPU said the dividend is of "modest size," representing  less than a third of the amount paid as a dividend by the  average electric utility.      "As the operating companies need to return to the capital  markets for debt and preferred stock, this should tend to  produce lower cost and better terms," the company said.      The dividend is payable May 29 to holders of record April  24.

VIran has deployed about six large  missiles near the Strait of Hormuz which increase the threat to  shipping in the Gulf, the New York Times said.      The paper quoted U.S. Intelligence sources as saying the  missiles appeared to be of a Chinese design known as HY-2 which  is based on the Soviet SSN2 or Styx missile.      Styx missiles have a range of up to 50 miles.      It said the missiles had been deployed at two sites and  quoted a naval analyst as saying they could be used to sink a  supertanker and block the Strait of Hormuz.      Missiles now used by Iran had only a fraction of the  explosive power of the Styx and could sink a supertanker only  with a lucky hit, the paper said.

The U.S. General Services Administration sold 5,490 tonnes  of tin in 1986, well above an agreed upon annual limit of 3,000  tonnes, the States of Malaya Chamber of Mines said.      In its latest annual report, it said the U.S. Had promised  to limit sales of tin in a memorandum of understanding signed  with the six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN) in December 1983.      "The U.S. Appears to have lost sight of the U.S./ASEAN  Memorandum of Understanding," the Chamber said.      The Chamber estimated the U.S. Strategic stockpile held  180,444 tonnes of tin in December 1986, 137,744 tonnes in  excess of of its original stockpile goal of 42,700.      The main ASEAN tin producers are Malaysia, Indonesia and  Thailand, which produce the bulk of the world's tin.

VThe Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow a  total of 800 billion yen worth of financing bills from its  holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of  1,700 billion yen, money traders said.      Of the total, 300 billion yen will yield 3.8992 pct on  sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in a  23-day repurchase accord maturing on April 24.      The remaining 500 billion yen will yield 3.8990 pct in a  31-day repurchase pact maturing on May 2, they said.      The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.8750 pct  one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 4.28/11  pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit.

VFrench maize producers will ask the EC  Commission to grant permanent maize export rebates following  the recent EC/U.S. Accord guaranteeing the U.S. An annual  export quota of two mln tonnes of maize for Spain over four  years, the French maize producers association, AGPM, said.      The Commission has already decided to accord rebates for  the export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize, of which rebates  for around 100,000 tonnes have been granted.      The request will be made when export certificates have been  granted for all the 500,000 tonnes, the AGPM said.      The association said that the request would cover exports  to all destinations, adding that the Soviet Union, which has  important maize needs, is currently excluded from the list of  destination countries for the 500,000 tonnes of French maize.

VVenezuela will back Ecuador's bid to  raise its OPEC quota above 221,000 barrels per day (bpd)  because it is a justifiable demand, Venezuelan Energy Minister  Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.      He told reporters the country deserved a higher quota in  compensation for the five months it was forced to suspend oil  production when its main pipeline was destroyed by an  earthquake last March.      "For this five-month period, Ecuador did not exercise its  right to produce 221,000 bpd," he said. "We should recognize  Ecuador's right to increase its quota ... There is a basis of  justice in that country's petition."      He added however, the quota increase should be gradual to  avoid harming the market, he added.

VAvery Inc said the company will not  show a profit in the next quarter and will probably not show a  profit in 1987.      Speaking at the annual shareholders meeting, chairman  Nelson Peltz declined to estimate when the company would become  profitable.      Peltz said Uniroyal Chemical Co, acquired last year, would  increase Avery's operating earnings but that associated  acquisition costs would prevent Avery from posting net profits  for some time.      At the meeting, stockholders approved an increase in the  authorized number of common shares to 200 mln from 15 mln.      In the fiscal year ended May 30, 1986, Avery reported a  loss of 489,000 dlrs. The company has changed its fiscal year  to end Sept 30.

Michel Lefebvre, vice president of operations, said Noranda  will operate the mine at about one-third of its normal 72,000  metric ton annual finished capacity, using above ground  reserves, until it decides whether to keep the mine open.      "The events we sustained yesterday and the day before are a  very serious setback for Gaspe Mines operations," Lefebvre said.  Gaspe Mines is the name of the Noranda division that operates  the Murdochville mine.      He said it would take four or five months to bring  operations up to full capacity if the company decides to do so,  adding that he believes there is a good chance Noranda will  fully reopen the mine.

Washington said the platforms were used to monitor shipping  and to launch small-boat attacks on shipping. The French  statement described the target as "an Iranian military platform."      But the French statement added that "everything must be done  now to avoid that these military developments lead to a new  escalation of the conflict."

VThe 11,254,837 acres of highly erodable  farmland submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for  the conservation reserve program was within trade guesses of  10-12 mln and should have an overall neutral impact on grain  and soybean prices Monday, grain traders said.      Farmers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in  the conservation program to take advantage of a corn bonus  rental payment that was offered by the USDA, which may underpin  new crop futures, they said.      New crop corn prices firmed earlier this week on ideas of a  large sign-up in the program. But traders noted that the poor  yielding acres being set-aside will result in only a modest  decrease in final production figures, since farmers will  concentrate on high yielding land.      Of a total 11,254,837 erodoble acres submitted, usda  accepted 10,572,402 acres into the program at an average rental  payment of 51.17 dlrs per acre.

VChina has raised the state purchase  prices of corn, rice, cottonseed and shelled peanuts from April  1 to encourage farmers to grow them, the official China  Commercial Daily said.      The paper said the price paid for corn from 14 northern  provinces, cities and regions has increased by one yuan per 50  kg. A foreign agricultural expert said the rise will take the  price to 17 fen per jin (0.5 kg) from 16 fen.      The paper said the price for long-grained rice from 10  southern provinces and cities was raised by 1.5 yuan per 50 kg.      The paper said the price for round-grained rice from 11  provinces, regions and cities in central, east and northwest  China has been increased by 1.75 yuan per 50 kg. It gave no  more price details.      It said local authorities must inform farmers of the price  increases before farmers begin planting, to encourage  production of grains and oilseeds.      Chinese officials have said farmers are unwilling to grow  grain because they can earn more from other crops.

VPhilippine coconut oil exports to Europe  would be virtually wiped out if the European Community (EC)  implements a new tax on vegetable oils, Philippine Coconut  Authority (PCA) chairman Jose Romero said.      But he told reporters he did not think the EC would impose  the tax because of objections from the U.S.      "There's just so much flak coming from many countries,  spearheaded by the United States, whose soybean exports would  be adversely affected. This would spark a trade war," he said.      The tax, to be imposed from July, would add about 375 dlrs  a tonne to vegetable oils entering the EC.      The Philippines exported 43,540 tonnes of coconut oil worth  11.7 mln dlrs to Europe in January, against total exports of  86,959 tonnes worth 23.8 mln. It also exports copra and copra  meal.

VThe European Community Commission has  told EC member states that it is not prepared to discuss EC  sugar prices while sugar traders threaten to make a huge sale  into intervention stocks to protest against its policies,  Commission sources said.      "Our position is that we are not willing to discuss the  problems of market prices at a time when traders are making  threats," one source said.      The sources said the Commission's view was made clear at a  meeting of its sugar management committee today.      They said French, West German and Dutch officials had  informed the committee that traders in their countries intended  to sell just over 850,000 tonnes of sugar into EC intervention  stocks.

VFloods and avalanches killed 110 people  and caused around 350 mln roubles worth of damage in the  southern Soviet republic of Georgia earlier this year, the  government daily Izvestia said.      Some 80,000 hectares of agricultural land and gardens had  been inundated, damaging tea plantations and orange groves, the  newspaper said.

Dan Kaakebeen a spokesman for the Dutch salvage firm Smit  International told Reuters by telephone from Rotterdam that the  vessel was just off the Belgian port of Zeebrugge with 463  passengers and crew when the accident occurred at 1850 GMT.      Kaakebeen said the firm had one vessel at the scene and  another on its way with divers on board.      A spokesman at the port authority of nearby Vlissingen said  attempts were being made to pull the vessel into shallow  waters.      Weather conditions were good with no fog or wind, and there  were many other vessels in the area.

VThe government plans to go ahead with a  three billion franc package to help the long-term unemployed,  with the aim of guaranteeing social security payments to  everyone becoming redundant, government officials said.      At present only about one-third of the country's 2.6 mln  jobless, corresponding to 10.9 pct of the workforce, receive  unemployment benefit.      Prime Minister Jacques Chirac told a television  interviewer, "As soon as the law is approved, and it will be in  a matter of weeks, all workers made redundant will have the  right to social benefits."      The money, which will be used to alleviate unemployment  through retraining or project finance, will come from a 7.5  billion franc government fund set up last month to finance  spending on special areas of concern.

Each  has a circulation of about 160,000 copies.       The magazine group had revenues of eight mln dlrs last  year and employs 50 people, Telemedia said.                   Telemedia said it will also acquire a 10 pct interest in  the company which recently launched the U.S. edition of  Harrowsmith.      The magazine's U.S. editiion, begun last year, now has a  paid circulation of 180,000, the company said.      It said a final deal is expected in mid-April.      Telemedia said the magazines' founder has agreed to  continue to provide editorial and publishing direction for the  magazines.

VThe Soviet oil production target for 1988  has been set at 625 mln tonnes, a rise of eight mln tonnes over  this year's planned output.      Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday  at the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament.      He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil  deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an  upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation  which began in late 1983.      Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil,  slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln.      January-September figures released at the weekend showed  Soviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467  mln tonnes. The 1987 target is 617 million.      Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oil  deposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geolog  prospecting across the country to spur the oil industry.

"The United States is fully entitled to take military action  in exercise of rights of self-defense, in the face of the  imminent threat of further attacks," Howe said in a statement  issued in London.      The United States said its forces destroyed the platform on  Monday in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack on a U.S.-  flagged Kuwaiti ship last Friday.      Referring to that attack, Howe added, "I trust the Iranians  will fully understand that continued attacks of this kind will  only enhance justification for firm action in self-defense."      At a press conferenced in Luxembourg during a meeting of  European Community (EC) ministers, Howe was asked about  statements from a senior Iranian official who said America was  now involved in a full-scale war.      "It would be profoundly undesirable and quite unjustified  for Iran to react in that way," he said.

VMaize deliveries to Zimbabwe's  state-owned Grain Marketing Board (GMB) will fall by over 65  pct this year, following a prolonged dry spell, agricultural  industry sources said.\u000aThey said 1987 maize deliveries are expected to decline to  around 520,000 tonnes from 1.6 mln tonnes last year.\u000aThe sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a  25 pct increase in cotton production to 315,000 tonnes from  248,000 tonnes last year, and by a rise of 20 pct in soybean  deliveries to 100,000 tonnes from 84,000 tonnes in 1986.

VTurkey pulled warships back from close  escort of its Sismik 1 survey ship as the threat of conflict  with Greece over oil rights in the Aegean Sea abated.      The semi-official Anatolian Agency said naval vessels ended  their close protection of the ship as it continued work in  Turkish waters but were following it at a distance.      Popular newspapers headlined what they saw as Turkish  resolve and international pressure forcing Greece to pull back  from planned exploration in disputed international waters.      "Intense United States and NATO efforts bore fruit: Greece  will stay in its national waters," said the daily Gunes. The  top-selling Hurriyet topped its front page with: "Our resolute  stand made Greece see reason."      But two newspapers, Cumhuriyet and Milliyet, noted in  identical headlines -- "Crisis Frozen" -- that the basic  disagreement over exploration rights remained unsolved.      The confrontation eased after the Turkish government said  it had been assured Athens would not begin prospecting in  disputed waters.

VThe Kuwait Central Bank kept its window  for funds to the domestic interbank deposit market shut as  banks returned from a four day holiday, dealers said.      The move drove short-term interest rates sharply higher,  with overnight and tomorrow-next funds more than doubling from  last Wednesday and hitting 20 pct.      There were few offers in a tight market and traders  scrambled for any available funds. One-month to one-year  deposits were indicated one point higher at eight, seven pct  but there was little activity at the longer end of the market.

VShares in Cable and Wireless Plc  &lt;CAWL.L> firmed in morning trading on market speculation that  its participation in a joint telecommunications venture in  Japan would not be curtailed, dealers said.      The company's shares were quoted at 372p at 0915 GMT  compared with 364p last night.      The dealers said the speculation appeared to originate in  Japan. Cable has said it is resisting attempts by the  Federation of Economic Organisations to merge two Japan-based  telecommunications firms, a move which would have cut Cable's  stake from 20 pct in one to three pct in the merged unit.      However, the dealers were uncertain exactly how the dispute  over the shareholdings had been resolved.

VThe Development Bank of Singapore Ltd  (DBS) said Malaysia's real gross domestic product growth (gdp)  in 1987 could be 1.5 to two pct, above a budget target of one  pct.      It said in a report that because of an economic recovery  and higher foreign exchange reserves, the Malaysian ringgit is  unlikely to face devaluation in the near future.      The report was presented at a two-day investment conference  organised by the DBS, one of Singapore's four major banks.      The report said rising commodity prices and the continued  expansion of the manufacturing sector coupled with rigorous  fiscal restraints and a more stable currency are grounds for  cautious optimism about the Malaysian economy.      It forecast the ringgit will remain stable at between 2.60  and 2.70 Malaysian dlrs to the U.S. Dollar for the rest of the  year.      But the report said the growth rate of Malaysia's external  debt remains worrying and should be controlled.

VGTE Corp said the decline in its  first quarter net income reflects a 121 mln dlr loss from its  50 pct share ownership of U.S. Sprint's operations.      This loss is an increase from the 60 mln dlrs loss reported  on operations GTE owned a year ago quarter and prior to  entering a joint venture with United Telecommunications &lt;UT> in  July 1986. Under the joint venture, each company owns 50 pct of  Sprint.      Earlier, the company reported net income declined to 265.0  mln dlrs from 283.0 mln dlrs in the first quarter a year ago.      Theodore Brophy, chairman of GTE said, "we expect US  Sprint's losses to diminish later this year as customer traffic  migrates to the new fiber-optic network for long distance  telecommunications.      The reason for the higher losses reflect lower prices as  well as higher operating costs related, in part, to the  fraudalent use of the network.

VSanta Fe Southern Pacific Corp will  later today formally ask the U.S. Interstate Commerce  Commission (ICC) to reconsider its earlier rejection of the  merger of the holding company's railroad assets, a company  spokesman said.      "We expect to file papers late tonight" asking the ICC to  reopen the rail merger case, spokesman Rich Hall said in a  telephone interview from the company's Chicago headquarters.      The ICC had rejected in July, on grounds it would reduce  competition, the merger of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific  Railroads.      The deadline for seeking ICC reconsideration of the merger  plan is midnight tonight.      Santa Fe Southern Pacific owns the Santa Fe railroad and  holds the Southern Pacific railroad assets in trust while  awaiting federal approval of the merger plan.      The ICC had ordered the holding company to divest one or  the other railroad but stayed its ruling pending a decision on  the request for reconsideration.

The stock jumped 2-1/2 to 98-3/4.      Smith said the company ended 1986 with a strong cash  position of about 639 mln dlrs as compared to 158 mln dlrs the  year before. "This implies the possibility of a share buyback,  or significant dividend increase or a stock split," he said.      In addition, he said the company has been gradually  adjusting its merchandise mix and its gross margins have been  improving.      Smith expects the company to earn 8.25-to-8.50 dlrs a share  in 1987 as compared to the 7.06 dlrs a share earned last year.  Last year's results include a 69 cent charge for the buyback of  debt.

Speaking at a House foreign agriculture subcommittee,  Roberts said the U.S. has offered eep to China and Poland, and  should also include the Soviet Union.      Rep.

V&lt;SNC Group Inc> expects 1987 earnings  to rise to 1.20-1.40 dlrs a share from 91 cts a share last  year, with revenues climbing to about 430 mln dlrs from last  year's 350 mln dlrs, president Alex Taylor said before the  annual meeting.      SNC, Canada's second biggest engineering and construction  group, became the country's largest ammunition manufacturer  last year with its 90 mln dlr acquisition of Canadian Arsenals  Ltd from the Canadian government.      The impact of that and several smaller deals will be felt  fully in 1987, Taylor said.      Defense preoducts and other manufacturing operations will  account for more than half SNC's total 1987 revenues, helping  to counterbalance the more cyclical engineering and  construction acivities, Taylor said.      Last year, SNC earned 8.7 mln dlrs, including a small  extraordinary gain.      In 1987, a total manufacturing activities will generate  about 235 mln dlrs in revenues, and engineering and  construction about 200 mln dlrs, he said, adding that defense  products operations should be a major contributor to earnings.

VLoans and advances from the Dutch  Central Bank to the commercial banks fell 1.01 billion guilders  to 9.5 billion guilders in the week ending March 30, the Bank's  weekly return showed.      Dealers said payments by the Dutch state, partly in the  form of civil service wages, had outweighed payments to the  State, causing the money market deficit to ease.      The Treasury's account with the Bank dropped 960 mln  guilders to 6.5 billion guilders.      Liabilities in gold or foreign currency rose 200 mln to  11.9 billion guilders.      Dealers said it was more likely that the alteration in this  item on the weekly return indicated normal commercial foreign  exchange business rather than intervention by the Central Bank.       The Bank itself does not disclose information on  intervention.      Seasonal variation brought bank notes in circulation up 190  mln guilders to 29.7 billion guilders.      Total gold and currency reserves rose 173 mln guilders to  56.4 billion guilders.      Call money and period rates were barely changed in the  week. Today all were traded at 5-3/8 to 5-1/2 pct.

VBritish Telecommunications Plc &lt;BTY.L>  expects to announce satisfactory results for its 1986/87  financial year ending March, chairman Sir George Jefferson said  in a third quarter statement.      Full year results will be published in June. In the 1985/86  financial year, pre-tax profit rose to 1.81 billion stg from  1.48 billion in the previous period.      Jefferson said good progress was made in the latest nine  months, while most customers were able to maintain their normal  level of calls during the recent strike by company engineers.      The statement said a positive cash flow of 381 mln stg for  the first nine months will diminish in the final quarter due to  corporation tax and dividend payments.      Earlier, the company reported third quarter pre-tax profit  for the period ended December 31 of 506 mln stg compared with  452 mln a year earlier. Nine month pre-tax was 1.51 billion stg  against 1.35 billion.

VWhether the European Community's  Council of Ministers will approve a proposed tax on vegetable  oils that has sparked threats of U.S. retaliation is uncertain,  an EC official said.\u000aU.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has threatened  retaliation if the tax is approved, as it would limit U.S.\u000aDenman said while the EC is willing to negotiate about  agriculture in a new round of trade talks, it is unwilling to  single out export subsidies on a negotiating agenda or put  agricultural policy on a special fast track.\u000a"The key to a solution in this area seems to me not in the  framing of the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)  wording...but in tackling government subsidies to farmers on  both sides of the Atlantic," he said.

It would also reduce export credits that do not involve aid  and reduce credit subsidies permitted for relatively poor  countries, the Treasury said.      Baker said the agreement imposes particular sacrifices on  Japan and praised Japan's willingness to accept the pact as a  demonstration of the Japanese government's willingness to take  concrete steps to resolve important trade issues.

VBank of Canada Governor John Crow said he  expects the Canadian economy will grow moderately in the coming  year, despite the near flat growth in the final quarter of  1986.      "We see moderate growth," Crow told a news conference  following presentation of the central bank's annual report in  the House of Commons today.      He said there were positive signs of growth in the economy,  particularly the drawdown of business inventories in the fourth  quarter. Yesterday, Statistics Canada reported gross domestic  product expanded a slight 0.2 pct in the quarter.      Crow reiterated the bank's previous statements that  inflation remains a major priority in setting monetary policy  and said only zero inflation would be acceptable. Canada's  inflation rate is currently hovering around the four pct mark.      The governor said Canada's banking system remains sound  despite recent concern about exposure by the country's banks in  debt plagued countries such as Brazil.

VThe tin price is likely to rise to  20 ringgit a kilo this year because of the producers' accord on  export quotas and the reluctance of brokers and banks to sell  the metal at lower prices, a Malaysian government bulletin  said.      The Malaysian Tin bulletin said it is in producers'  interest to keep to their quotas to limit total exports to  90,000 tonnes and to gradually deplete the 80,000 tonnes  overhang.      It said consumption by industrialised countries should stay  at 160,000 tonnes and that International Tin Council creditors  and brokers are not likely to dump their stocks excessively  unless there is a large and abrupt price jump.      The continued depreciation of the dollar could also help  push up the price of tin, the bulletin said.      A depreciation of the dollar means the depreciation of the  ringgit which is closely pegged to it, making the price of tin  cheaper in sterling terms, it added.      "Even in the absence of economic rationale in the tin  market, psychological optimism alone is sufficient to secure a  price recovery of up to 20 ringgit per kilo," the bulletin said.

The Pentagon announced on Monday that U.S. warships  destroyed a non-producing oil platform used for monitoring Gulf  ship traffic and military operations, and also raided a second  Iranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier Iranian attack on  a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag.      Many Democrats, who control Congress, and Republicans  expressed support for the attack and praised it as an  appropriate "measured response."      But Democrats and liberal Republicans voiced new fears that  the growing confrontation between Tehran and the United States  could erupt into a major war, and demanded that Reagan comply  with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of  American forces from the waterway.      "Those who contend the strike was necessary must realize  their words are easily construed as a tacit endorsement of war  with Iran," said Sen Mark Hatfield of Oregon, a Republican.

VThe new interest rate of 7/8 pct over  Libor on Venezuelan public sector debt payments goes into  effect today, Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua said .      Azpurua told reporters yesterday the reduction from the  previous margin of 1-1/8 pct above Libor will save the country  some 50 mln dollars in debt servicing.      The new rate is among changes agreed last month to the 20.3  billion dlr public sector debt rescheduling. Under the new  agreement, Venezula was also able to extend the term from 12 to  14 years and to lower debt payments in the 1987-89 period by 64  pct.      Azpurua said that according to the agreement, the new  interest rate will be retroactive to April 1, provided the  accord is approved before October 1.      He told reporters the term sheet detailing the changes in  the rescheduling has already been endorsed by the 13-member  debt steering committee and is now being sent to the country's  460 creditor banks for their approval.

VFinance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he  regards a U.S. Dollar below 150 yen as counter to the agreement  struck by major nations in Paris last month.      He told the Upper House Budget Committee in Parliament that  Japan intervened in the market when the dollar went below 150  yen, as it considered the dollar's fall below that level  counter to the spirit of the Paris accord.      Commenting on current foreign exchange movements, Miyazawa  said Japan would watch developments for another couple of days.      Institutional investors appeared to have sold dollars to  hedge currency risks ahead of the end of the financial year  today, Miyazawa said.      Behind the recent dollar fall lies the market perception  that major nations were not doing enough to implement their  policies under the Paris pact, he said, noting that passage of  Japan's 1987/88 budget has been delayed.      He said that now was the time for major nations to act  under the Paris accord. The U.S., West Germany, France,  Switzerland and Britain have intervened on their own account to  prop up the dollar, he said. This was a concerted action.

Under the deal, PDVSA will supply up to 140,000 barrels a  day to the refinery with the option to place 50,000 bpd more -  mostly gasoline and distillates - through Champlin's  distribution system in 10 U.S. states.      The new company will be directed by a six-member board,  with three representatives each from PDVSA and Union Pacific.

VFederal Reserve Board Chairman Paul  Volcker said current data does not give a clear sign that the  deterioration in the U.S. trade balance has yet been reversed.      "The data we have in hand do not provide clearcut evidence  that the deterioration in the trade balance has yet been  reversed," Volcker said in remarks prepared for delivery to a  luncheon for community leaders here.      However, Volcker said there are encouraging signs,  particularly the rising volume of exports over the past year,  achieved despite relatively slow growth abroad.      Volcker warned it is not sustainable from an economic  perspective to pile up foreign debt while failing to make the  investment needed to generate growth and earn the money to  service the debt.      He said the process of restoring external balance to the  U.S. economy requires dealing with the budget deficit. He said  needed economic adjustment will require a relative shift of  financial and real resources into internationally competitive  industry. "More of our growth will need to be reflected in net  exports and business investment and less in consumption,"  Volcker said.

A company spokesman said the proposals appear to have been  made in today's edition of the Japanese daily Asahi by Fumio  Watanabe, head of a telecommunications committee with the  Federation of Economic Organisations.      However, the suggestion still recommended a merger between  the two consortia tendering for contracts and would give Cable  a five pct stake, more than the three pct originally proposed  but less than the 20 pct it holds in its original venture, he  said.

VSaudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah  bin Abdul Aziz was thanked by the Reagan administration for his  country's close, and closed-mouthed, cooperation with  Washington in the Gulf, a senior U.S. official said.      "The Saudis are being very cooperative. It would be nice if  the Saudis would go more public, but it's their real estate,"  said the official who asked not to be named.      He declined to describe what sort of help the Saudis were  providing, saying that Saudi officials are reluctant to  acknowledge their role in the Gulf where the United States has  stationed forces to protect shipping lanes.      The prince met Vice President George Bush on Monday after  U.S. naval forces attacked offshore Iranian oil platforms in  what Washington said was retaliation for an Iranian attack on a  ship moored off Kuwait and flying the U.S. flag.      Asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the  attack, the prince, who is here on an official visit, replied,  "I believe what the United States has done is their  responsibility as a superpower."      The senior U.S. official said his remark was an endorsement  of the U.S. attack.

VIndonesia's coffee production in  1986/87 ending September 30 may fall slightly from last year's  level of 360,000 tonnes, Dharyono Kertosastro, chairman of the  Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters told Reuters.      He said shade trees had been damaged by pests and this may  have affected the crop, though it remains to be seen how  seriously. Indonesia's main crop is harvested next month.      He gave no figure for expected output, except to say it  would probably be down a little from 1985/86. He said stocks  were about normal at 90,000 tonnes.      Kertosastro predicted that exports were unlikely to rise  much from last year's level of 320,000 tonnes. "I expect exports  will be a bit more, maybe 330,000 tonnes, but not above that,"  he said.

VThe Soviet Union supports the freedom  of navigation in the Gulf and does not support any act which  would cause the deterioration of the situation in the region,  its ambassador to Kuwait, Ernest Zverev, told the Kuwaiti news  agency KUNA.      "We support the freedom of navigation in the Arabian Gulf  and the Strait of Hormuz," the agency quoted Zverev as saying.      KUNA also said the envoy had discussed the deployment of  Iranian missiles near the Strait of Hormuz with Kuwaiti Foreign  Undersecretary Suliman Majed al-Shaheen.      A British naval source in the Gulf said today Iran had  test-fired its new Silkworm missiles and set up launching sites  in the area.      The tests had been successful and the missiles could be  used against shipping in the strait, the source added.      But Iranian Parliamentary Speaker Hojatoleslam Akbar  Hashemi Rafsanjani said Iran did not need missiles to close the  strait because "we can close it with artillery only."      The U.S. Has said it will not allow Iran to use missiles to  choke off oil shipments and offered its warships to escort  Kuwaiti tankers past the missile batteries in the strait.

VCanada's softwood lumber will become  unprofitable for some forest product producers if prices  decline to about 175 U.S. dlrs per thousand board feet of two  by four inch lumber from current levels of about 195 U.S. dlrs,  Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam Zimmerman told  reporters.\u000aZimmerman reiterated profitability has been hurt by a move  by Canadian negotiators to impose last January a 15 pct export  tax on softwood lumber shipped to the U.S. in exchange for a  U.S. lumbermen's lobby dropping its request for a countervail  duty.\u000aZimmerman said the adverse impact from lower U.S. lumber  product prices would be felt by lumber mills in eastern Canada  first, migrating westward.

The new offer values the diversified auto parts  manufacturer's 27.22 mln ordinary shares and 13.22 mln first  participating preference shares at 202.2 mln dlrs.      Formal documents will be sent to shareholders as soon as  possible, it said in a brief statement.      BTR Nylex, which manufactures rubber and plastic products,  first bid for BWA in late January.      As previously reported, Borg-Warner Corp, which owns 65 pct  of BWA's ordinary shares and 100 pct of the preferences,  advised a month ago that it would not accept the offer.      This meant BTR Nylex's 50.1 pct acceptance condition could  not be met, BWA said in a statement reporting its parent's  decision.      BWA advised shareholders to ignore the offer and said other  parties had expressed interest in bidding for it.      But no other bid has yet emerged.      BTR Nylex is a 59.5 pct-owned listed subsidiary of  Britain's BTR Plc &lt;BTRX.LON>.

It said there were good opportunities for growth in both  existing and recently acquired businesses as well as for growth  by acquisition in related areas.      It earlier announced a 6.1 mln stg rise in pre-tax profit  to 24.8 mln stg for the year to December 28. Turnover rose to  242.1 mln from 211.5 mln.

VThe Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI) has asked about 30 Japanese trading houses and  exporters to refrain from excessive dollar selling, trading  house officials said.      The officials told Reuters MITI asked them to moderate  their foreign exchange trading because the excessive rise in  the yen will have unfavourable effects on the economy. It made  the request by telephone.      A MITI official said the ministry has conducted a survey of  foreign exchange trading by trade houses and exporters. But he  said it was not aimed at moderating dollar selling.      The trading house officials said MITI had asked them to  undertake foreign exchange transactions with due consideration  to the adverse effects excessive exchange rate movements would  have on the economy.      The MITI official said MITI undertakes such surveys when  exchange rates fluctuate widely. A similiar survey was made  when the currency fell to the previous record low of 149.98 on  January 19. It hit a new record low of 148.20 yen yesterday.      He said the survey showed currency transactions by trade  houses and exporters contributed little to the dollar fall.

So far this year, API said growth in domestic demand, which  was up 2.9 pct from last year's year-to-date level, has slowed  in comparison to the accelerated growth in the last half of  1986.      It said crude oil production for the first two months of  1987 was off 8.6 pct from the comparable year-ago period while  crude imports were up 30.6 pct.

VThe Great Northern Nekoosa Corp  said it will recommend to shareholders a two-for-one common  stock split.      The company said it will make the proposal to shareowners  at its annual mmeting May 6 in Dothan, Ala., near the company's  Great Southern Paper division operations.      In conjunction with the stock split proposal, the  shareowners will be asked to approve an increase in the  authorized common stock from 60 mln to 150 mln shares, the  company said.      The company said it will propose an increase in its  dividend rate if the split is approved effective with the June  payment.      The company said the present rate on GNN common is 43 cts  per share. The company said it would recommend a quarterly rate  of 23 cts a share on the split stock. This would be equal to a  dividend of 46 cts a share on the present common, seven pct  higher than the current rate.      The company said it had increased the dividend by 13 pct  last December. Great Northern Nekoosa's last common stock  split, a three-for-two, was in December 1983, it said.      As of Dec 31, 1986, there were 26,661,770 shares of GNN  common stock outstanding, according to the company.

VThe United States wants Taiwan's  currency to appreciate faster to reduce Taiwan's trade surplus  with the U.S., A senior trade official said.      Board of Foreign Trade director Vincent Siew told reporters  on Saturday U.S. Officials told him in Washington last week  that unless Taiwan allowed its dollar to rise faster it would  face retaliation.      Siew returned from Washington on Friday after the U.S  responded to Taiwan's request to increase its textile export  quotas by promising further talks in May. Taiwan's surplus with  the U.S. Hit a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986.      Washington signed a three-year accord with Taipei last year  limiting textile export growth to 0.5 pct a year.      Siew said the Taiwan dollar had risen by about 15 pct  against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985.      It surged last week amid indications Washington was seeking  a major rise in its value. It rose four cents against the U.S.  Dollar on Saturday to close at 34.59.      Western trade sources told Reuters Taiwan and the U.S. Have  been holding talks on the currency issue but added it is not  clear how far Washington wants to see the Taiwan dollar rise.

VFrench money supply, measured in terms of  M-3, rose a provisional one pct in January after falling 0.7  pct in December, the Bank of France said.      M-3 is the main money supply aggregate used by the French  monetary authorities. It has been joined as a second main money  supply aggregate for 1987 by M-2, which rose a provisional 1.2  pct in January after falling a confirmed 0.9 pct in December.      Calculated on a three-month moving average basis, M-3 rose  4.4 pct year-on-year in the quarter based on December after  rising 5.4 pct in the quarter centred on September.      The M-2 aggregate, centred on a three-month moving average,  rose year-on-year by four pct, within a 1987 target range of  four to six pct.      M-1 rose 2.5 pct after a 1.1 pct fall in December. M-1  measures notes and coins in circulation plus sight deposits.      M-2 adds in short-term bank deposits and M-3 adds in other  short-term deposits.      The central bank's widest measure of liquidity, L, rose 1.5  pct in January after one pct fall in December. The bank said  the money supply growth reflected a net increase of sight  deposits and renewed interest in money market instruments.

Lastly, Baldrige said that the United States was hopeful  that it could complete a free market agreement with Canada by  the autumn, but said major issues, including acid rain,  remained unresolved.

VSecretary of Commerce Malcolm  Baldrige expressed concern about the continuing U.S. trade  deficits with South Korea and Taiwan and said that without an  adjustment in exchange rates there is little likelihood of  improvement.\u000aSpeaking to the President's Export Council, an industry  advisory group, Baldrige said the trade deficit issue was under  discussion with those countries.\u000a"I feel that unless we see an exchange rate adjustment we  probably won't be able to see much of a change in the large  surplus that Taiwan in particular has with us," he said.

VPaul Volcker's decision not to go for a  third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination of  Alan Greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns about  the U.S.' ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stem  rising inflation, financial market analysts said.      Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflation  fighter in the Volcker mould, doubts are already surfacing in  the U.S. financial markets as to whether he has enough  political clout and monetary experience to wage a tough  campaign against inflation over the next year or two.      "The critical issue is how (Greenspan) will deal with  inflation," said Stephen Axilrod, Vice Chairman of Nikko  Securities Co International Inc and former staff director for  monetary and financial policy at the Fed.      "A lot of questions have been raised by Volcker's  departure. Until Greenspan answers them, the markets will  remain nervous," added Stephen Slifer, money market economist  at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.

VThe United States and Japan will  soon settle their trade dispute over semiconductors, U.S.  Commerce secretary Malcolm Baldrige said on television.      Baldrige, referring to the U.S.-Japan trade agreement on  semiconductors, said: "Their government wants to live up to it.  Their industries haven't been doing it, and I think we'll have  a good settlement to spare both sides."      "I think the Japanese understand full well that they haven't  lived up to this commitment," he said.      He added: "I do not think there will be a trade war at all."      On Friday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300  mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods from April 17,  because of Tokyo's failure to observe the agreement.      The officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon as  Japan started adhering to the agreement. But they said there  was little chance Japan could react quickly enough to avert the  higher tariffs.      Baldrige said the Reagan administration hoped the strong  U.S. Action against Japan would convince Congress to tone down  protectionist trade legislation now being drafted.      He denied the action had been taken for that reason.

VDutch sugar traders deny involvement  in a plan to offer more than 850,000 tonnes of sugar to  intervention in protest at EC export policy and prices, traders  told Reuters.      Although some 2,500 tonnes of sugar have been offered to  intervention in the Netherlands, Dutch producers and traders  said this sugar was actually Belgian and was being offered by  the Belgian industry.      "We sympathise with the actions of the French, West German  and Belgian traders and producers, but we are not party to it,"  a spokesman said.      EC Commission sources said yesterday French traders planned  to sell 775,000 tonnes into intervention stocks, West German  traders 75,000 tonnes and Dutch traders 2,500. Dutch trade  sources gave the same figure for France, but estimated up to  110,000 tonnes offered by German traders and producers.      The Dutch spokesman added, "The weekly export tender policy  and prices are squeezing the European sugar industry, and this  is the only way in which they can really register their  protest.      "These are desperate actions, but we believe that most of  this offered sugar will be withdrawn within the three-week  breathing space allowed."

VInternational monetary officials will   rush to paper over the deep cracks that have appeared in the  Louvre accord on currency stability to prevent a dollar  free-fall and to calm turmoil in world capital markets,  economists and currency traders said.      "I don't think the Louvre is dead because if it breaks up  in an acrimonious way, the potential outcome is a rout of the  dollar, higher interest rates and collapsing stock markets.  It's in the Group of Seven's interest to calm things down,"  said Douglas Madison, corporate trader at BankAmerica Corp.           In a weekend television interview, U.S. Treasury secretary  James Baker sharply criticised a recent rise in West German  money market rates and said the eight month-old Louvre pact to  foster exchange rate stability needs to be reviewed.      His comments rocked the currency markets and helped send  the already-fragile U.S. and overseas stock markets into a  tailspin.      The dollar lost more than two pfennigs in the U.S. to about  1.7740/50 marks and about one yen to 141.25/35 yen. The Dow  Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 200 points at one  stage and U.S. Treasury bonds dropped about 1-3/4 points.

VLong delays at the railway crossing on  the Kenyan border have led Uganda to re-route its coffee  exports through a ferry link with the Kenyan port of Kisumu  across Lake Victoria, Ugandan officials based in Kenya said.      Uganda has a direct rail link with the Kenyan port of  Mombasa through which it conducts 70 pct of its external trade  but there is a chronic shortage of railway wagons, they said.      Customs at Kisumu take less than a day compared with two to  three at the Malaba rail border crossing, a Ugandan Railways  official said. "Malaba is now handling only 10 pct of the trade  and all the coffee and oil goes through Kisumu," he said.      However, an accident recently damaged the wagon ferry which  plies between Kisumu and the Ugandan port of Jinja, causing  bottlenecks on the lake route too.      Sources at the Coffee Marketing Board in Kampala reported  delays in coffee export shipments last January due to  congestion on the lake ferries.      Coffee accounts for about 95 pct of Uganda's export  earnings and last November President Yoweri Museveni ordered  all coffee shipments to be carried by rail in order to avoid  the higher costs of road haulage.

VSince 1986 U.S. oil production has fallen while\u000a  consumption rose and that has raised dependence on imported\u000a  oil, particularly from OPEC, DiBona said.

VAmerican Petroleum Institute President  Charles DiBona said no options should be rejected to combat   growing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.      "No action should be ruled out--import fees or quotas,  floor prices, tax incentives or other alternatives--while a  national dialogue on the issue continues," DiBona said at a   paper institute conference in New York today.      DiBona said there is no unanimity within the industry on  how to stimulate energy production but there is consensus on  removing several government policies that hinder investments in  new prospects.      DiBona said the windfall profit tax should be abolished  immediately and current proposals for increased environmental  regulations on acid rain and waste disposal should be not  adopted. He also suggested that the Arctic National Wildlife  Refuge in Alaska should be opened up for leasing to oil  companies, DiBona said.      "This is a battle the industry cannot afford to lose if the  nation is to continue to benefit from Alaskan oil," DiBona  said. Since 1986 U.S. oil production has fallen while  consumption rose and that has raised dependence on imported  oil, particularly from OPEC, DiBona said.

VThe current crude oil price of between  18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next couple  of years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to  keep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said.      Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade  officials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint  by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government  officials said.      They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made  the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third  World debt and industrialised nations.      Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher  energy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said.

VFormer Prime Minister Robert  Muldoon, an outspoken advocate of a managed float for the N.Z.  Dollar, said the currency is at least 10 pct overvalued.      Muldoon said in a speech last night the exchange rate  should be around 48 U.S. Cents instead of the current 57 cents.      "A reasonable value for the New Zealand dollar would be  between 10 and 15 pct less and nearer 15 than 10. Perhaps  around about 48 cents," he said.      The Labour Party government removed exchange controls and  floated the dollar two years ago when it was worth 44 cents.      Muldoon has no rank in the opposition National Party, and  party leaders, with an eye to general elections to be held by  September, have rejected his calls for a managed float.      He said the dollar was high because of "grossly excessive"  interest rates for government stock.      "I know of no other country which is implementing such a  free floating policy," he added. "There is widespread agreement  internationally that we have no alternative to floating  currencies in the short to medium term. But we need more  effective methods of managing them so as to limit the  volatility which has caused so much concern and damage."

VBritain's Defence Minister George Younger  said the U.S. Was unfairly protecting its defence industry, and  this could lead to British firms demanding counter-measures.      Younger told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce meeting that U.S.  Legislators were failing to realise "the true nature of the  two-way street in terms of ideas, technology and equipment.      A British parliamentary report said that up to March  British firms had been awarded just 34 mln dlrs worth of  contracts for the Strategic Defence Initiative, compared with  the 1.5 billion dlrs Britain had hoped to secure.      The committee said U.S. Technology export restrictions and  "selectiveness" towards foreign contractors had denied British  competitors more lucrative orders and largely excluded them  from technological research for SDI.      Younger said London had given U.S. Companies contracts  under conditions of fair and open competition. "All we ask is  for our companies to be given similar opportunities," he added.      If new American legislation aimed at curbing unfair  subsidies was used to exclude foreign suppliers it would not be  surprising if British firms pressed for retaliatory measures,  Younger said.

VGrain handling at Rotterdam port's  main grain terminal was at a standstill today as members of the  largest Dutch transport union FNV staged a lightning strike for  the third day running.      Pieter van der Vorm, managing director of Graan Elevator  Mij (GEM), which handles 95 pct of grain passing through the  port, said their main Europoort terminal was out of action  because of a strike by technical staff.      The actions, in support of union demands in negotiations  over a new labour agreement, began on Wednesday when grain  handlers stopped work.      Van der Vorm said that if strikes continued on today's  scale for some time vessels coming to unload grain in Rotterdam  would face delays, but this was not happening yet.      Wednesday's actions left GEM's facilities 40 pct  operational, and there were only limited strikes yesterday.      Talks between unions and employers yesterday and today  produced no result, but FNV spokesman Bert Duim said the union  was prepared to put their key demand, for a 36 hour working  week, at the bottom of the agenda.

VWorld stocks of silver are large  enough to accommodate any changes in the supply-demand equation  this year, with industrial consumption expected to again exceed  mine production, the dealer house Handy and Harman said in its  annual review of the silver market.      The house estimated that the industry last year withdrew  20,000,000 ounces of silver from stocks to bridge a supply  deficit caused by a consumption rate of 403,000,000 ounces and  production level of 382,000,000 ounces.      However, world stocks are huge, totaling 2,267,900,000  ounces at the end of 1986, it said.      The review noted that world industrial consumption has been  on an uptrend since 1980, although offtake is still 14 pct  below the 1978 level of 442,000,000 ounces.

He said  geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery  of oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay.      "The area could contain potentially recoverable oil  resources of more than 9.2 billion barrels, an amount nearly  equal to the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which currently provides  almost one-fifth of U.S. domestic production," Hodel said.      He said production from the new section could begin about  the time Prudhoe Bay production begins to decline in 2000  without endangering caribou or other wildlife in the area.

VCommerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige  has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned  Japanese acquisition of a major U.S. Computer and semiconductor  maker, U.S. Officials said yesterday.      The officials told reporters Baldrige had serious concerns  on national security grounds about the sale of Schlumberger Ltd  &lt;SLB> unit &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Inc> to Fujitsu Ltd  &lt;ITSU.T>. The officials said the sale could leave the United  States overly dependent on a foreign company for equipment used  in advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligence  gathering.      The U.S. Officials added the sale would also worsen the  strained relations between the two countries stemming from the  huge Japanese trade surplus.      The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the  sale in the coming weeks, they said.      Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger's position was not  known, but in the past, he has opposed the transfer of high  technology to foreign governments or companies.      Computers made by U.S. Manufacturers are widely used in the  world, but Tokyo told U.S. Negotiators recently it prefers  local manufacturers and would not buy U.S. Supercomputers.

VA limited Belgian issue of silver Ecu  coins with a face value of five Ecus will go on sale from March  23 at a price of 500 Belgian francs each, a Finance Ministry  spokesman said.      Gold Ecu coins with a face value of 50 Ecus will be sold  from the same day. The spokesman told Reuters the price for  these would be fixed just before they go on sale but was likely  to be between 8,500 and 9,000 francs.      At least two mln silver coins and several hundreds of  thousands of the gold coins will be minted, he said. They will  be sold both in Belgium and abroad.      The coins will be the first ever denominated in the Ecu,  the "basket" comprised of the 12-nation European Community's  currencies except the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo.      The issue is being made to mark the 30th anniversary of the  EC's founding Treaty of Rome this month.

NCR said the increase in first quarter profit resulted from  strong revenue growth, which was particularly strong in Europe  and Pacific marketing groups.      Growth in U.S. revenues also improved, the company said.  First quarter revenues increased to 1.12 billion dlrs from  960.8 mln dlrs in the prior year.      NCR's U.S. dollar value of 1987 first quarter worldwide  incoming orders posted a very substantial gain over the prior  year first quarter, NCR also said without giving specific  figures. Order growth was broad based across NCR's product  lines, with the greatest growth coming from U.S., it said.

V&lt;Prudential Corporation Plc>, which  earlier announced a 62 pct rise in 1986 pre-tax profits, said  it had recorded its best general insurance result for six years  but had not reached satisfactory levels of profit in other  areas.      Group Chief Executive Brian Corby told a news conference  that despite returning to trading profits, the International  division and the Mercantile and General division had not  reached satisfactory levels.      But he said he welcomed Mercantile and General trading  profits in 1986 and was optimistic about both that and the  International division.      The acquisition of the U.S. Life company &lt;Jackson National>  had a small effect in 1986 but its full effect would be felt in  the 1987 results, Corby said.

VShares of Polaroid Corp rose following  a reiterated recommendation by Merrill Lynch and Co that  focused on strong earnings momentum for the company, traders  said.      "We have been recommending the stock since it was in the  50s, but we reiterated today because of expectations of strong  earnings momentum, its benefits from the lower dollar and  anticipation of nice gains in margins," Merrill Lynch  analyst Charles Ryan said. He said a negative opinion by  another brokerage house hurt the stock Wednesday, and it can be  bought at a relatively bargain price today.      Ryan said "you always have to look at Polaroid at its  weakness. Its a volatile stock that has to be caught on  weakness." Polaroid's stock, which gained more than a point  early this morning, was trading at 76-1/8, up 5/8. It was down  over three points Wednesday morning before closing down 7/8.      "Polaroid is working overtime on production of cameras and  film, so we expect first quarter earnings to be up about 40  pct," Ryan said, estimating earnings of 70 cts a share in the  first quarter compared to 52 cts a share earned a year earlier.

VStrong growth in domestic demand was a key  feature of the economies of southern European countries in  1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.      In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's total  domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to  five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth  restrained private consumption.      Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and  domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected  to be halved to five pct next year.      In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment,  had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross  Domestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption  were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain  strong.
