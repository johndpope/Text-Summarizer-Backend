p4238
aVHowever, IAFMM said in a statement that it expected Chilean  and Peruvian fish meal production in the first quarter of 1987  to be much lower than the 651,000 tonnes produced in the last  quarter of 1986, due to a ban on sardine fishing in Chile for  the month of February and to adverse fishing conditions in Peru  in the same month.

aVVenezuela's energy and mines minister arturo hernandez  grisanti earlier described the agreement, under which pdvsa  buys 50 pct of champlin's corpus christi refinery, as "one more  step in the maturation and presence of our oil industry in  world markets."

aVunion pacific chairman william cook said the agreement will  be beneficial to both sides, combining a secure source of  supply with a modern refinery and access to markets.
p5342
aVAdams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even with  an oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily over  the years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelan  heavy crudes with coking and hydro-treating facilities and  obtain a competitive product yield.
p5343
aV"therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been a  consideration in the negotiations, and it remains to be seen  what such a fee would represent, we do not foresee any impact  on today's agreement," adams said.

VLichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference  here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much  as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high  level of 47 pct in 1977.
p5346
aV"The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is  inevitable," Lichtblau said.
p5347
aVLichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for  33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to  40 pct by 1990.
p5348
aV"An international floor price adopted by all or most  industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective  measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if  we imposed it alone," Lichtblau said.
p5349
aVDevelopment of alternate energy sources such as synthetic  fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen  U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.

aVLichtblau also called for the federal government to offer  tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans  for alternative energy.

VA half point cut in base lending rates  was announced by the big four clearing banks today after the  Bank of England finally endorsed such a move following weeks of  downward pressure, dealers said.
p5360
aVThe timing of the Bank of England move took operators by  surprise after its recent action seemingly designed to dampen  hopes of a base rate cut ahead of the U.K. Budget on March 17.
p5361
aVFor some time, fundamentals have  led the market to push for a one point cut in base lending  rates to 10 pct but the central bank has declined to follow  wholesale money market rates down.
p5362
aVAlthough political considerations -- the government's wish  to see a fall in base rates coincide with the Budget -- had  been suggested by operators last week as reasons for the Bank's  delaying action, worries about the real strength of sterling  and perhaps about the market's reaction to the content of the  Budget may have been behind the central bank's caution, dealers  said.
p5363
aVConsequently, rates in the money market eased during the  day, one-month interbank sterling shedding 5/16 point to  10-9/16 7/16 and three-months trading 1/16 point down at  10-5/16 3/16 pct.
