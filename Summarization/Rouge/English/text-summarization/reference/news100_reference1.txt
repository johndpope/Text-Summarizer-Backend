The companies said the agreement would allow Computer's  unsecured creditors and debenture holders to receive new stock  in exchange for exsiting debt, and for shareholders to receive  one new share of Computer's stock for each four shares  previously held.
The companies said the United States Bankruptcy court for  the Southern District of New York has given preliminary  approval for the proposal, which is subject to formal approval  by Computer's creditors and the court.
