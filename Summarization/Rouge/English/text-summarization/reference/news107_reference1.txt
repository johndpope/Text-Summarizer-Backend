Michel Lefebvre, vice president of operations, said Noranda  will operate the mine at about one-third of its normal 72,000  metric ton annual finished capacity, using above ground  reserves, until it decides whether to keep the mine open.
"The events we sustained yesterday and the day before are a  very serious setback for Gaspe Mines operations," Lefebvre said.
He said it would take four or five months to bring  operations up to full capacity if the company decides to do so,  adding that he believes there is a good chance Noranda will  fully reopen the mine.
