Energy Secretary John Herrington  said his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowance  to 27.5 pct was probably the most economically promising way to  spur domestic production.
Herrington said of the increased depletion allowance  option: "that is one that could significantly increase  production at a very low cost to the American taxpayer."      He again rejected an oil import fee as far too costly to  the overall U.S. economy.
