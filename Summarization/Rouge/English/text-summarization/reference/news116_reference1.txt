Indonesia expects crude palm oil (CPO)  prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne FOB  sometime this year because of better European demand and a fall  in Malaysian output, Hasrul Harahap, junior minister for tree  crops, told Indonesian reporters.
Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despite  making recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that it  could possibly increase its international market share.
Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary  shortage than to lose export markets.
