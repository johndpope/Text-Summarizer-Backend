Existing 500-franc "B"  tranche certificates would be split five-for-one.
The split would improve the marketability of the existing  certificates, chief executive Giorgio Ghiringhelli told a news  conference.
The new bearer shares would be priced at 1,500 francs,  compared with a closing price last Friday of 3,325 on the  Zurich Stock Exchange, while the registered shares would be  issued at 300 francs against a market price of 900.
