InterCare Inc said it has  agreed to terminate the proposed acquisition of &lt;Universal  Care> because &lt;First Jersey Securities> has withdrawn as  underwriter for a proposed offering of InterCare securities.
The company said the offering was to have raised 7,500,000  dlrs for working capital through the sale of equity and debt  and would have also financed the 1,897,000 dlr cash portion of  the Universal Care purchase price.
The company said to improve its working capital position,  it plans to reduce operating expenses by decreasing hours of  operation and its workforce and selling some assets.
