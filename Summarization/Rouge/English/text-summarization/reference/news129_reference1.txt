Canada's gross domestic product rose 0.1  pct, seasonally adjusted, in January after gaining 1.0 pct in  December but falling 0.1 pct and 0.3 pct in November and  October, Statistics Canada said.
January's rise, in 1981 prices, was fueled largely by a 0.5  pct gain in the goods producing sector.
Output in  services-producing industries declined 0.1 pct from December's  level.
The federal agency said it was the second straight gain for  goods producing industries.
