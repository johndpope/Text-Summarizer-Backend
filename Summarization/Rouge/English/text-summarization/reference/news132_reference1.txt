British press magnate Robert Maxwell said  his British Printing and Communication Corp Plc would not renew  its bid for Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc &lt;HBJ> if the lawsuit  filed against Harcourt in New York today fails.
British Printing filed suit in U.S. District Court in  Manhattan to block what Maxwell called a fraudulent  recapitalization announced by Harcourt last week.
Harcourt, in response to a hostile two billion dlr takeover  proposal from Maxwell, planned a recapitalization that would  pay shareholders 40 dlrs per share.
