Eli Lilly and Co said its board  decided to sell Elizabeth Arden Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary  that manufactures and markets cosmetics and fine fragrance  products.
Lilly said it expects to use the after-tax proceeds from  the sale of its cosmetics business for general corporate  purposes, including the repurchase from time to time of its  common stock or warrants on the open market.
In a statement, Lilly Chairman Richard Wood said "This  strategic decision was reached on the basis of our belief that  in the future the corporation's resources, including its  research activities, should be focused on its other business  which have a high technology, life sciences orientation."
