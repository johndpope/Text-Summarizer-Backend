In a speech to the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce,  Clausen said he was "absolutely convinced" BankAmerica would  return to its position of preeminence.
Clausen said he doubts BankAmerica would be in a position  this year to make any acquisitions or experience any growth.
He said BankAmerica will continue to reduce staff and  operations, noting that expense growth in 1986 increased only  one pct over 1985 expenses.
