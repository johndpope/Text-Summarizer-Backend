Light, scattered showers covered  winter wheat areas in the North China Plain in the week ended  March 14, moistening topsoils for wheat, just breaking dormancy  in most central and northern areas, the Joint Agricultural  Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce  Departments said.
Above-normal February temperatures over the North China  Plain caused winter grains to break dormancy early in the  south.
The agency said the wet weather in these areas provided  ample moisture for rice planting and lessened the need for  irrigation.
