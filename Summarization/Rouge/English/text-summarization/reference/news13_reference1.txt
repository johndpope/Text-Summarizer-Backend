Taft Broadcasting Co said its  board continues to explore alternatives, such as a possible  financial restructuring, in response to a Theta Corp offer of  150 dlrs per share for Taft stock.
Taft also said the new proposal would be submitted to the  board but no decision had been made with respect to the sale of  the company.
In the proposal, Theta said it was prepared to discuss all  aspects of the offer including price, structure and form of  consideration and would be prepared to negotiate a transaction  in which shareholders would receive a value in excess of 150  dlrs per share.
