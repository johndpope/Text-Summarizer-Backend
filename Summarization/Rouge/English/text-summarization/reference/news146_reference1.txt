French soft wheat exports to other  European Community countries fell 18 pct to 4.13 mln tonnes in  the first seven months of the 1986/87 season to January  compared with 5.04 mln in the same 1985/86 period, the French  Cereals Intervention Office (ONIC) said.
British and Greek imports of French soft wheat during this  period were below year-ago levels.
ONIC said the drop in French exports to other Community  countries was due to British competition.
