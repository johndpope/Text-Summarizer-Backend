Xebec Corp said it expects to  report a loss for its second quarter ended April three, due  principally to a decline in sales to International Business  Machines Corp &lt;IBM>, the company's largest customer.
Xebec also said it expects revenues to total about 23 mln  dlrs.
Xebec said IBM has historically accounted for about 50 pct  of the company's revenues, but that total fell to 20 pct during  the quarter just ended.
