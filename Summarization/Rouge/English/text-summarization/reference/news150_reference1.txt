U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel  Lawson said the Government was going ahead with this month's  flotation of British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> shares despite the  collapse on international stock markets.
"We are going ahead because the whole issue has been  underwritten - we had it underwritten because there is always a  risk of this sort of thing happening," Lawson said in a BBC  radio interview.
There is  absolutely no reason not to do so," Lawson said.
