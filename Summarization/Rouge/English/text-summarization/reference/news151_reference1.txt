Spain's trade deficit narrowed to 581 mln dlrs compared  with 664 mln dlrs in January but the large increase in non-oil  imports contributed to the substantial increase over the 159  mln dlr deficit registered in February 1986.
Non-oil imports totalled 2.79 billion dlrs compared with  1.91 billion in February last year, reflecting the large  ammount of investment goods entering the country with the  recovery of the Spanish economy, the Bank of Spain said.
