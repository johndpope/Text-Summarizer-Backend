Attack on an Iranian target while calling for a swift halt to  the Gulf War to avoid further escalation.
"The French authorities reaffirm their attachment to the  freedom and security of navigation and to the right of all  states to take action under international law and the United  Nations charter to halt attacks such as that of October 16," the  Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement.
The United States said its forces destroyed an Iranian oil  platform in the Gulf and struck at a second on Monday in  retaliation for a recent Iranian missile attack on a  U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti ship.
