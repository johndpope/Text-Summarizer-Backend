The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of  delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall  because of dry conditions.
However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have  promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on  last fall's late seeding, it said.
Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the  situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out  of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the  report said.
