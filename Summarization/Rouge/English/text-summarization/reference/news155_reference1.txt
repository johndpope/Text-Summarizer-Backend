The five leading West German economic  research institutes, which have revised down their forecasts  for 1987 growth, do not predict a recession in West Germany,  their spokesman, Hans-Juergen Schmahl said.
Schmahl, presenting the report at a news conference, said,  "None of the institutes reckons with a recession or with the  beginning of a recession." He added, however, that exports  remained the weak point of the economy .
Arthur Krumper of Munich's Ifo institute, which with the  DIW of West Berlin had presented the more pessimistic view of  the economy, said, "The braking effects (on the economy)  produced by external factors will remain considerable for most  of the year."
