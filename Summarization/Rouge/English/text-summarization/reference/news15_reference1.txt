Westcoast  Transmission Co Ltd said it agreed to acquire the Western  Canada oil and gas reserves and properties of AGIP Canada Ltd,  a subsidiary of AGIP SpA, part of Italy's ENI group, for 54 mln  Canadian dlrs.
At the end of 1986, AGIP Canada reported proven and  probable reserves of 4.2 mln barrels of crude oil and natural  gas liquids and 22.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas.
Westcoast said the acquisition would enable it to apply  more than 150 mln dlrs of accumulated tax pools of AGIP Canada  Ltd to enhance after-tax cash flow from the acquired  properties.
