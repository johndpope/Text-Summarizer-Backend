The maximum export rebate granted at  yesterday's EC sugar tender marked no change in policy over  producer complaints that they are not obtaining the EC  intervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community, EC  Commission sources said.
The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for  118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previous  week, but the change is explained by world market conditions.
Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to  obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one  Ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week,  the sources said.
