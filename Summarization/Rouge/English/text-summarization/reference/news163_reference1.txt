Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige  said the U.S. trade deficit should start to decline soon,  possibly in the figures for February or March.
"We could see the trade deficit start down in February or  March," Baldrige said in an appearance before the Senate  Governmental Affairs Committee.
Ealier, Treasury Secretary James Baker told the committee  that the trade deficit had levelled off, but Baldrige said he  was more optimistic, adding, "I think we turned the corner in  February."
