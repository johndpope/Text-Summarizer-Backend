The proposed European Community (EC) tax  on vegetable oils and fats is no longer a major issue on the  agenda and the EC Commission merely used it as a threat, the  West German Feed Stuffs Industry Association (MFI) said.
"We have just avoided a trade conflict with the U.S. And the  Commission used the tax threat to calm national farm lobbies."      American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect Wayne  Bennett said yesterday in The Hague that U.S. Soybean producers  were confident the tax would be rejected.
