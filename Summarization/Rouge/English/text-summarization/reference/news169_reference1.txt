New Zealand's consumer price index,  CPI, which measures the rate of inflation, rose 2.3 pct in the  quarter ended March 31 against an 8.9 pct rise in the December  1986 quarter and a 2.3 pct rise in the March 1986 quarter, the  Statistics Department said.
Nearly half the increase in the latest quarterly index was  contributed by the housing group, the department said.
However, some GST charges not measured in the December 1986  quarter influenced the latest March quarterly figure, it said.
