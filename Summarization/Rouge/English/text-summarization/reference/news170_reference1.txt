A government official said that a  decision by Brazil not to import maize because it forecast a  record harvest would not affect Argentina's exports.
"We have heard nothing about this, but if Brazil has decided  not to import maize that is no problem for us as it is not one  of our main customers," Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries  Under-Secretary Miguel Braceras said.
Braceras said that last year Brazil bought 800,000 tonnes  of Argentine maize but in some years it had not imported any  from Argentina.
