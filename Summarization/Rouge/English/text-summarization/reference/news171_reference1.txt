Silver looks "unlikely to break out of  gold and platinum's shadow" in the near future, although this  year is likely to see demand increasing at a faster rate than  supply, a study by Credit Suisse said.
The study predicted demand rising by 300 tonnes to 13,200  tonnes this year, against a 50 tonne increase in supply to  14,050 tonnes.
However, the study said that primary production, likely to  reach 10,000 tonnes this year against a provisional 9,950 in  1986, is relatively insensitive to price falls.
