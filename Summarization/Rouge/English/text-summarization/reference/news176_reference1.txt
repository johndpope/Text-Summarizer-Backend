International Cocoa Organization (ICCO)  talks on buffer stock rules have slowed during a crucial phase  of negotiations, delegates said, but they remained confident  about prospects for reaching agreement by Friday.
Producers would prefer that non-member cocoa not be  included in the buffer stock because, if it is, countries such  as Malaysia benefit from the cocoa agreement without joining  it, the delegates said.
