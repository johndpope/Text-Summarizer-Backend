Central Bank president Francisco Gros  denied rumours that foreign creditors had filed court actions  against Brazil to seek payment of its 109-billion dlr debt.
"There is no court action against Brazil," Gros said in a  television interview.
Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68  billion dlr debt to commercial banks and yesterday suggested an  extension of short-term credit lines for 60 days until May 31.
