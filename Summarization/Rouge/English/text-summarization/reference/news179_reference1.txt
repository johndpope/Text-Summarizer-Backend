However, a spokesman for the Commission confirmed the  offers had been made to intervention agencies in various member  states, and said it would now take up to three weeks for the  agencies concerned to complete all necessary documentation.
The spokesman said the Commission would only have to  reimburse the member state for the cost of buying-in the sugar  after the product was sold out of intervention stores at a  later date.
He said that at present there was virtually no sugar held  in intervention stores.
