A 50 pct cut in the import tariff for  soybeans should help boost 1987 U.S. Soybean exports to Taiwan,  a spokesman for the joint committee of soybean importers told  Reuters.
The cut will encourage local importers to increase 1987  soybean imports to 1.9 mln tonnes from 1.74 mln last year, he  said.
"The tariff cut is very helpful for American suppliers (who  want) to boost their exports to Taiwan," Steve Chen, country  director of the American Soybean Association, told Reuters.
