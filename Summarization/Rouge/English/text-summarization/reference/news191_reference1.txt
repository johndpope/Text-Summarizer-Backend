U.K. Officials are studying the possible  link between the use of antibiotics in calf feeds and the  spread of drug-resistant strains of salmonella in humans, a  Ministry of Agriculture official said.
"The Ministry of Agriculture is concerned about the possible  effects on human and animal health," the official said.
The  government is also studying a recommendation from the Farm  Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) to restrict the trade of calves  under 56 days old through markets.
