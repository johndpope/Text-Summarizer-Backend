The Bank of Zambia has paid out foreign  exchange arrears from three auctions conducted last year, a  bank spokesman said.
The bank had not paid foreign exchange to private firms  since it suspended the weekly auctions on January 28.
Last week, he said the auction had run into trouble because  of a shortage of foreign exchange.
