A leading Soviet economist said the  practice of padding figures was significantly inflating the  country's industrial production data.
Most Western economists have for years allowed for a  certain padding of figures when analysing Soviet statistics for  industrial production.
He said the elimination of figure-padding and other  malpractices would save billions of roubles and would pay for  the Soviet Union's social development program up to the year  2000.
