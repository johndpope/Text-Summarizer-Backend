Philippine coconut oil exports to Europe  would be virtually wiped out if the European Community (EC)  implements a new tax on vegetable oils, Philippine Coconut  Authority (PCA) chairman Jose Romero said.
But he told reporters he did not think the EC would impose  the tax because of objections from the U.S.
The tax, to be imposed from July, would add about 375 dlrs  a tonne to vegetable oils entering the EC.
The Philippines exported 43,540 tonnes of coconut oil worth  11.7 mln dlrs to Europe in January, against total exports of  86,959 tonnes worth 23.8 mln.
