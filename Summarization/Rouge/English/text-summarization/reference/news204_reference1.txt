American Express Co's stock fell  sharply, reflecting, in part, investors' disappointment that  the company did not make an announcement about its plans for  brokerage unit Shearson Lehman Brothers, traders said.
Traders said many investors anticipated an  announcement this weekend that it would spin off Shearson  Lehman.
"It was part programs and part that there was anticipation  of an announcement of a spinoff or something with Shearson this  weekend, and that announcement never happened," one trader  said.
