French state-owned aluminium and special  metals group Pechiney said it has signed two protocols of  intent to set up joint ventures with the Soviet Union.
Pechiney said in a statement one accord was to set up joint  ventures manufacturing aluminium packaging for food and  cosmetics, while another was to produce machinery to  manufacture packaging.
The statement said joint working groups for each accord had  a three-month deadline to come up with contract proposals.
