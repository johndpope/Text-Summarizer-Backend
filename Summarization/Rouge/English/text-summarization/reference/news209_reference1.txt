Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said  major nations are taking action to stabilise exchange rates in  line with their agreement in Paris last month, government  sources said.
Miyazawa said he wishes to attend a meeting of seven major  nations (G-7) expected just before the IMF/World Bank Interim  Committee meeting in Washington starting on April 9.
Asked if the six nations had agreed to stabilise the dollar  at about 153 yen, the rate prevailing at the time of the Paris  talks, Miyazawa declined to give specific figures and said any  mention of specific rates would create an "unexpected situation."
