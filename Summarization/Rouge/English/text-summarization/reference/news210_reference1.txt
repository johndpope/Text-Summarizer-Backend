Brazilian cocoa exporters are not  likely to follow the example of Cocoa Producers Alliance, CPA,  members, who may limit sales of the product in an effort to  boost world prices, trade sources said.
"The cocoa market is completely free.
Unlike coffee, which  is controlled through export registrations, cocoa exporters in  Brazil operate at their own free will," a trade source said.
The sources said the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade  Department, CACEX, never interferes in the cocoa market by  rejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipment  criteria.
