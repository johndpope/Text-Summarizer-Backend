Total Petroleum NA &lt;TPN> shut down  several small crude oil pipelines operating near the  Texas/Oklahoma border last Friday as a precaution against  damage from local flooding, according to Gary Zollinger,  manager of operations.
One other small pipeline that Total also closed has a  capacity of 3,000 to 4,000 bpd and crosses the Red River in  Fargo, Texas, Zollinger said.
He said the closed pipelines run under river water and  could be damaged as the flooded rivers erode the river banks  and expose the piping.
