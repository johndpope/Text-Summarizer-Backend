The value of China's industrial output in  January and February this year was 14.1 pct higher than in the  same 1986 period, the New China News Agency said.
Output increased by 5.6 pct from January 1985 to January  1986 and 0.9 pct from February 1985 to 1986.
The agency said the most recent increase was largely due to  last year's poor performance.
It quoted unnamed economists as saying they expect 1987  industrial production to increase at a proper rate and with  better results, due to a cost-efficiency drive underway  throughout the country.
