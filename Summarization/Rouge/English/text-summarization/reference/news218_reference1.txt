"I think we are beginning to see more calm in those markets,"  Seger told reporters after a speech to the U.S. League of  Savings Institutions.
She said market forces have a major influence on exchange  rates and said she did not know the right value for the dollar  against the Yen or the Mark.
Seger told the Savings and Loan executives that she was  concerned about financial markets' absorption with exchange  rate influences.
"I am concerned that we have gotten so nervous," about  exchange rates, Seger said.
