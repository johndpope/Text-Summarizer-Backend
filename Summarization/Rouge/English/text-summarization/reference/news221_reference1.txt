Bethlehem Steel Corp said prices  for steel sheet products will be increased up to 30 dlrs a ton  effective January 3.
The company said transaction prices for contract accounts,  which have a duration of six months or more, will also be  increased to commensurate levels.
Prices for flat-rolled steel sheet, used in automobiles,  appliances and other products, vary widely between about 350  and 800 dlrs a ton.
The company said it was taking the actions to restore sheet  transaction prices to more equitable levels.
