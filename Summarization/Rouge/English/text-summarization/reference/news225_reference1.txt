At least 60,000 tonnes of corn worth 240  mln pesos have been smuggled into the Philippines over the past  few months, the Manila Bulletin newspaper said, quoting an  official in the National Food Authority (NFA).
Tan said a continuing drought affecting about 49,150  hectares of corn has led to the loss of 43,725 tonnes of corn  worth 174.9 mln pesos and contributed to the shortage.
