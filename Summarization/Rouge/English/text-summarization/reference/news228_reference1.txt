Institute of International Finance  Managing Director Horst Schulmann said that his orgnaization  has been forecasting further declines of interest rates in the  first half this year and then a levelling off and there is no  reason to change that.
Speaking to reporters, the bank research group said that  the increase in interest rates announced yesterday and other  activity in the foreign exchange markets did not indicate a  fundamental change in the outlook.
