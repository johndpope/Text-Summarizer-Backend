Late last year the Gevaert group of Belgium and West  Germany's VEBA AG &lt;VEBG.F> said they had each acquired a 12.5  pct stake in Hapag-Lloyd from Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> and  Dresdner Bank AG &lt;DRSD.F>.
Industry sources estimate Deutsche and Dresdner,  Hapag-Lloyd's majority shareholders, held about 75 pct of  Hapag-Lloyd's share capital before selling portions of it to  Gevaert and VEBA.
The two banks have said they eventually wanted to reduce  their stake in the shipping group to 15 pct each.
