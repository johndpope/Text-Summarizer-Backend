Japan's consumer price index (base 1985)  was unchanged at 99.7 in February from a month earlier, the  government's Management and Coodination Agency said.
The February year on year fall was due to lower vegetable,  fuel oil, petrol, electricity and gas prices, and despite  higher housing, education, footwear and clothing costs.
The unadjusted consumer price index for the Tokyo area  (base 1985) in mid-March rose 0.4 pct from a month earlier to  100.6, reflecting higher vegetable prices.
The index fell 0.3 pct year on year, the third consecutive  yearly drop, reflecting lower food and utility costs.
