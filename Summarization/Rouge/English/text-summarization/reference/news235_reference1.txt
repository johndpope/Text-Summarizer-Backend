Unemployment in the U.K. Fell a  provisional seasonally-adjusted 44,100 in February, to total  3.07 mln or 11.1 pct of the workforce, the Employment  Department said.
In January, seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by a  revised 1,100 to 11.3 pct, it said.
February was the seventh successive month that seasonally  adjusted unemployment registered a fall.
A Department spokesman said the sharp fall in February  reflected some compensation for the flat figure in January and  continued the downward trend seen in the past six months.
