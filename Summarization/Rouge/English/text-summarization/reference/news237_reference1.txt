An 11-day-old strike by  Brazilian seamen is affecting coffee shipments and could lead  to a short term supply squeeze abroad, exporters said.
A series of labor disputes and bad weather has meant  Brazil's coffee exports have been running at an average two  weeks behind schedule since the start of the year, one source  added.
Given Brazil's port loading capacity of around 100,000 bags  a day, even if normal operations were resumed immediately and  not interrupted by bad weather, some March registered coffee  will inevitably be shipped during April, they added.
