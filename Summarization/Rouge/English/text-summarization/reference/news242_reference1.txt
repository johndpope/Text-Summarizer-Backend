The controversial War Powers Act could require a pullout  of U.S. forces from the Gulf.
The Senate voted 67-28 to stop a filibuster and limit  debate to 30 hours on a bipartisan measure that requires Reagan  to report to Congress on Gulf policy within 60 days and calls  for a resolution to be passed in the House and Senate on the  situation in the volatile waterway 30 days later.
