ChemLawn said if Waste Management Inc &lt;WMX> intends to  participate in the bidding process, it will have to submit a  confidentiality agreement to Chemlawn financial advisor Smith  Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc.
ChemLawn said if Waste Management were to sign such an  agreement, ChemLawn would supply it with the same information  being supplied to other potential purchasers.
But it said it  will not make an exception for Waste Management which would  give that company an advantage in the bidding process.
