The state-owned Philippine National Bank  (PNB) will fund Toyota Motor Corp's &lt;TOYO.T> planned purchase  of its bankrupt former local partner's manufacturing facilities  for at least 193 mln pesos, a bank official told reporters.
Toyota has informed the Philippine government it plans to  produce cars again here in joint venture with a local partner.
Toyota severed ties with its Philippine partner of 20  years, &lt;Delta Motor Corp>, in 1984 because the local company  was suffering financial difficulties.
