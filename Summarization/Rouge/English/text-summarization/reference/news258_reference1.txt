Talks at the extended special meeting of  the International Coffee Organization (ICO) on the  reintroduction of export quotas continued, but chances of  success were still almost impossible to gauge, delegates said.
Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombian  proposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September,  with a promise to define specific new criteria by which a new  quota system would be calculated in September for the new crop  year, they said.
No fresh proposals other than the Colombian initiative had  been tabled formally today, delegates said.
