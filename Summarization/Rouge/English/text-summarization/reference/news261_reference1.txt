The 1992 deadline for abolishing economic  barriers within the European Community should help French  economic growth and create jobs, president of the French  employers' federation CNPF Francois Perigot said.
We know that we have  to reestablish growth at three pct a year to solve the enormous  problems confronting us -- and I am referring mainly to  unemployment," Perigot added.
Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said yesterday that  French growth would be just two pct this year, the same as last  year and compared with the government's original 2.8 pct  target.
