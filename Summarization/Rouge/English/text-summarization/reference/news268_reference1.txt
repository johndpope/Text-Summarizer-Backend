Compaq Computer Corp said it expects  sales and earnings for the first quarter of 1987 to be higher  than analysts expectations due to strong demand for its  products.
Rod Canion, president and chief executive officer of  Compaq, said he expects sales of over 200 mln dlrs for the  period ending March 31, above analysts' estimates of 165-185  mln dlrs.
"The initial demand for the recently introduced COMPAQ  PORTABLE III and the new models of the COMPAQ DESKPRO 286  exceeds that of any other Compaq personal computers," Canion  said.
