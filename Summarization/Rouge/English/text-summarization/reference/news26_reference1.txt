In the note to its 1986 financial statement, American  Century said it considered the five mln dlrs collectible,  making its loan loss provision less than required.
The company said in spite of the SEC decision, it still  feels its allowance for possible loan losses at June 30, 1986  was adequate and that it has considered all relevant  information to determine the collectibility of the five mln dlr  receivable.
