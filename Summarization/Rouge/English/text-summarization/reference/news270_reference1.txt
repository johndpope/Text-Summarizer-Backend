Colombia's coffee export registrations  remain open and there are no plans to close them since a new  marketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered,  Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters'  association said.
Without giving breakdowns, Arango said private exporters  had registered 1,322,804 bags this calendar year up to April 6,  or roughly 440,000 bags per month, slightly lower than the  average in recent years.
"The only change that could happen is, because of the  volume, we would be told that from such a date, registrations  would be for June shipment, etc" Arango said.
