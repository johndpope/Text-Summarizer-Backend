Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a  larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are  opened for French barley a large amount could be put into  intervention.
The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exports  to non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000  tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in  1985/86.
The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decision  to hold special export tenders for French maize, he said.
