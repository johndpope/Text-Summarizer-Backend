Sri Lanka today ordered its armed forces  to defend the island's territorial waters as India prepared to  send a flotilla with relief supplies that Colombo says it does  not want for the Tamils in the Jaffna peninsula.
"President (Junius) Jayewardene has ordered the army, navy  and air force to protect the island and its territorial waters,"  Premadasa said to a round of applause from the house.
