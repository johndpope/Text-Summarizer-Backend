Floods and avalanches killed 110 people  and caused around 350 mln roubles worth of damage in the  southern Soviet republic of Georgia earlier this year, the  government daily Izvestia said.
In the most detailed report to date on the heavy snows in  January and floods in February, Izvestia said 8,200 people had  been evacuated from mountain areas, 4,500 houses had been  damaged and hundreds of kilometres of roads and power lines had  been destroyed.
A separate article in the daily warned that a sudden thaw  was expected shortly in the Ukraine and southern parts of  Russia, which experienced record snows this winter.
