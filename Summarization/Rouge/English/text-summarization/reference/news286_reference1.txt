BIL chief executive Paul Collins said: "All Rainbow has done  is to outlay a substantial amount of cash to purchase shares  from parties who presumably were supportive of the merger."      Rainbow has proposed a merger with Progressive to form a  new company, &lt;Astral Pacific Corp Ltd>.
Under the merger,  shareholders in both Progressive and Rainbow will be issued  shares in the new company on a one-for-one basis.
"Quite simply, Rainbow should now bid for the balance of  Progressive Enterprises at 4.80 N.Z. Dlrs per share," Collins  said.
