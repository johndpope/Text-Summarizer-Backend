Niagara Mohawk Corp said it is  "cautiously optimistic" about results improvements for 1987 and  said it is studying measures to cut operating costs.
The company said it has redeemed about 273 mln dlrs in high  cost debt during 1986 and hopes to redeem more debt this year.
The company said earnings reduced primarily as a result of  a reduction early in 1986 in earnings return on equity allowed  by the N.Y. State Public Service COmmission.
Niagara said it is concerned about the continued lowering  of authorized return and has reinforced petitions to grant a   fair return on equity.
