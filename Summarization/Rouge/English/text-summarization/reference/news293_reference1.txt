U.S. Trade Representative Clayton  Yeutter said he plans a July trip to China to discuss trade  issues including China's admission to the General Agreements on  Tariffs and Trade.
Yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible China  could be a member of GATT before the end of the year.
Depending on how the negotiations go on the terms of  China's GATT membership, Yeutter said he could put the final  touches on the U.S. part of the agreement during his trip.
The admission of China to GATT, which is the multinational  group of nations which negotiates international rules on trade,  would offer both potential export markets and potential  competition for U.S. industries, he said.
