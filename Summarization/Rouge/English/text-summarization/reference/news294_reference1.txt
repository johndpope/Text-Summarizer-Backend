At present only about one-third of the country's 2.6 mln  jobless, corresponding to 10.9 pct of the workforce, receive  unemployment benefit.
Prime Minister Jacques Chirac told a television  interviewer, "As soon as the law is approved, and it will be in  a matter of weeks, all workers made redundant will have the  right to social benefits."      The money, which will be used to alleviate unemployment  through retraining or project finance, will come from a 7.5  billion franc government fund set up last month to finance  spending on special areas of concern.
