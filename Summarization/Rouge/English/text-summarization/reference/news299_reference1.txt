Moody's Investors Service Inc said the  212.75 mln dlrs of debt of USAir Group Inc and its USAir Inc  unit remain under review for possible downgrade.
Under Moody's review for possible downgrade are USAir  Group's Baa-1 senior debt and Baa-2 subordinated debentures,  along with the USAir unit's A-3 senior debt and Baa-1  subordinated debentures.
Moody's said it would examine the effects of the proposed  mergers on USAir Group's financial measurements, as well as  potential damage to the company's financial flexibility because  of the probability of increased debt-service requirements.
