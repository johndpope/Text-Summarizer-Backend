Flowers Industries Inc said it  expects lower earnings for the current year due to operating  losses incurred by recent acquisitions and possible  nonrecurring losses resulting from its restructuring efforts.
Flowers said losses suffered in its West Texas operations  and in five plants acquired at the start of the third quarter  from &lt;CFS Staley Continental> and &lt;Wolf Baking Co> severely  hurt results.
It said the CFS and Wolf plants are expected to be  contributing to profit by the end of the fiscal year and it is  seeking to bring the West Texas operations to acceptable levels  of profitability by the end of the fourth quarter as well.
