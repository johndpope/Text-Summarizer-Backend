Wolverine World Wide Inc said  it signed a letter of intent to sell to an investment group two  subsidiaries, Kaepa Inc, an athletic footwear maker, and its  international marketing arm, Kara International Inc.
Wolverine said the action continues the restructuring  operation begun last July to make the company more competitive  and profitable.
Wolverine said it will concentrate its effort  in the athletic footwear market in its Brooks footwear  division.
Wolverine said it expects "favorable results in the second  half as a result" of its restructuring.
