The Soviet Communist Party has criticised  the country's Grain Products Ministry for failing to ensure  proper grain storage, turning out poor quality bread and for  unsatisfactory book keeping, Pravda said.
Its new leader, Gennady Kolbin, has said that at times the  grain-growing republic has performed so badly that it has been  obliged to seek grain supplies from national reserves.
Tass news agency announced yesterday that Grain Products  Minister Grigory Zolotukhin, 75, was being retired and replaced  by Alexander Budyka, a senior food industry official.
