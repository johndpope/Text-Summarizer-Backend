In its report on U.S. Export Markets for U.S. Grain, the  department noted Senegal had bought 100,000 tonnes of wheat  under the Export Enhancement Program last November, but local  opposition from millers, accustomed to French wheat, has been  delaying deliveries.
The department said if deliveries of U.S. wheat to Senegal  remain on track, the U.S. could dominate a wheat market that  had been expected to import 140,000 tonnes of mostly French  wheat during the 1987/88 (July-June) season.
