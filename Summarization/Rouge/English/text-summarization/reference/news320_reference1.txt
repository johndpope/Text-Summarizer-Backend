British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey  Howe backed the United States' attack on an Iranian oil  platform on Monday and said it should not worsen the Gulf  crisis.
"The United States is fully entitled to take military action  in exercise of rights of self-defense, in the face of the  imminent threat of further attacks," Howe said in a statement  issued in London.
