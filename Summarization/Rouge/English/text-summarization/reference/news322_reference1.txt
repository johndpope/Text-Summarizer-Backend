International LPG prices were little  changed in the past week, barely affected by the excitement on  the advent of OPEC's mid-year meeting, traders and industry  sources said.
"If the OPEC decides to increase crude oil production," a  traders said, "LPG supplies will be up without corresponding  rise in demand."      Petrochemical buyers were sidelined, after their foray in  the market early in june, they said.
Delivered propane to Japan was quoted at gsp plus 19 dlrs  and butane at gsp plus 25 dlrs, the traders said.
