Treasury Secretary James Baker said  the agreement among industrial nations in Paris last month is  only a start in Washington's drive to intensify economic  cooperation among leading countries.
In a speech to the National Newspaper Association, Baker  said "the six steps beginning with the Plaza Agreement and  culminating in the Paris Accord, are only a start."      He added "we see our role as a steward of a process in which  we sit down with our industrial allies to find ways to promote  more balanced international growth."      The Paris agreements called trade surplus countries to  strengthen their growth and on the U.S. to reduce its budget  deficit.
