Governments represented at a meeting to consider a proposed  forum for copper have recommended that another session be held  in September to consider further the nature of such a group, a  spokesman for the United Nations Conference on Trade and  Development (UNCTAD) said.
The one-week meeting, which ended today, was held to  examine a U.S. Initiative to set up a copper study group.
UNCTAD's spokesman said, "Once they have agreed on detailed  functions and objectives, then the way will be cleared to  setting up the body."
