Rain over wide areas has raised the  prospect of good food crops throughout Ethiopia, which suffered  a disastrous drought and famine two years ago.
Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648,000 tonnes  a year, of which 250,000 tonnes are produced from the "belg"  (small) rains which fall at this time of year.
The government had distributed large quantities of seed and  fertiliser, and the rains should ensure a good crop.
