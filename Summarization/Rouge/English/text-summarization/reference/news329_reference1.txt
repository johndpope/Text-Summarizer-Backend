Maize deliveries to Zimbabwe's  state-owned Grain Marketing Board (GMB) will fall by over 65  pct this year, following a prolonged dry spell, agricultural  industry sources said.
They said 1987 maize deliveries are expected to decline to  around 520,000 tonnes from 1.6 mln tonnes last year.
The sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a  25 pct increase in cotton production to 315,000 tonnes from  248,000 tonnes last year, and by a rise of 20 pct in soybean  deliveries to 100,000 tonnes from 84,000 tonnes in 1986.
