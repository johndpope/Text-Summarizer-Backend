The Belgian National Bank said it cut  one, two, and three month treasury certificate rates, all by  0.10 points, effective immediately.
A National Bank spokesman said the modest cut was made  after a decline in domestic money market rates yesterday, and  was not expected to be followed by a cut in the 7.60 pct  discount rate.
The discount rate has been the market's penalty rate rather  than a guiding rate since 1985, and its advances are currently  little used as liquidity is ample, bank economists said.
