The U.S. Has been promised a near  monopoly of maize exports to Spain from third countries  guaranteed under an agreement with the European Community, an  EC official said.
Under the accord, which began in January, third countries  were guaranteed access for the next four years for two mln  tonnes a year of maize to the Spanish market, as well as  300,000 tonnes of sorghum.
The EC Commission is to ask member states to agree either a  tender system to fix reduced import levies for the maize or to  authorise direct imports by the Spanish intervention board.
