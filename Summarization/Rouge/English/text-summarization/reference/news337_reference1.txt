Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige  said he supported efforts to persuade newly-industrialized  countries (NICS) to revalue currencies that are tied to the  dollar in order to help the United States cut its massive trade  deficit.
Baldrige told a House Banking subcommittee that the  Treasury Department was attempting to persuade those countries  to reach agreement with the United States on exchange rates.
