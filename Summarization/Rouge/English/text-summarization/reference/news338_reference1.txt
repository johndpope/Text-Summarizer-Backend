Turkey pulled warships back from close  escort of its Sismik 1 survey ship as the threat of conflict  with Greece over oil rights in the Aegean Sea abated.
Popular newspapers headlined what they saw as Turkish  resolve and international pressure forcing Greece to pull back  from planned exploration in disputed international waters.
The  top-selling Hurriyet topped its front page with: "Our resolute  stand made Greece see reason."      But two newspapers, Cumhuriyet and Milliyet, noted in  identical headlines -- "Crisis Frozen" -- that the basic  disagreement over exploration rights remained unsolved.
