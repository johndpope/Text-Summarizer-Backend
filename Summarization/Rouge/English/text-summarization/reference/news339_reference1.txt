American Motors Corp &lt;AMO> management  has ordered a hiring freeze in view of Chrysler Corp's &lt;C> 1.5  billion dlr takeover bid, a spokesman for AMC said.
Chrysler, the number three U.S. Automaker, has said the  merger is motivated principally by its desire to acquire AMC's  profitable Jeep business and dealers, as well as a new modern  car assembly plant in Bramalea, Ontario.
That means a guaranteed future for much of AMC, but it  leaves in question the fate of many of its 19,000-plus  employees, according to industry analysts.
AMC's Toledo, Ohio  Jeep plant has 1,850 hourly workers on indefinite layoff while  its Kenosha, Wisconsin, car plant has another 2,250 on layoff.
