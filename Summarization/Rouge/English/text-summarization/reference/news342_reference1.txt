The Association of White Metals has  decided to publish a daily tin price here in French francs per  100 kilos, the French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals said.
The price, quoted for the first time yesterday, was  introduced as the lack of tin quotes was causing problems for  some French companies, a spokesman for the non-ferrous metals  association said.
The Association has tested the basis it uses to calculate a  French franc price over the last few months to ensure it was  reliable, the spokesman said.
