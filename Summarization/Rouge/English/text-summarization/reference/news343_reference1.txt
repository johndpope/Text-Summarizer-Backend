Bank of Spain governor Mariano Rubio said  the central bank was worried that money supply was growing too  fast, reflecting excessive internal demand in the Spanish  economy, but added that he was confident recent measures would  succeed in restricting money growth.
He added that real GDP growth of three pct in 1986 was due  to a six pct increase in real internal demand and a three pct  real drop in the contribution of the external sector.
The aim for 1987 was for the same real growth in GDP but a  drop in the internal contribution to 4.5 pct with the negative  component of the external sector trimmed to 1.5 pct, he said.
