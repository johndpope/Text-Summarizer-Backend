Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said he  was maintaining his 2.5 pct inflation target for 1987 after the  announcement earlier today of a 3.4 pct year-on-year rise in  retail prices for February.
A Finance Ministry statement said the year-on-year  differential between French and lower West German inflation  rates, calculated on the last three months, had narrowed in  February to two to 2.3 pct compared to 2.7 pct in January.
