The Houston Endowment is selling the paper to comply with  federal tax laws requiring charitable institutions to divest  themselves of profit-making subsidiaries by 1989.
The Chronicle has a daily circulation of over 425,000 and  is in competition with the Houston Post, owned by the &lt;Toronto  Sun Publishing Corp>, with a circulation of about 316,000.
The acquisition gives Hearst its biggest newspaper holding  in Texas, where the California-based publisher already owns  papers in San Antonio, Beaumont and Laredo.
