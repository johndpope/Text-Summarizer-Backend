Secretary of Agriculture Richard  Lyng will meet with representatives from major grain exporting  companies today, and the subject of subsidized wheat to the  Soviet Union will likely be discussed, an aide to Lyng said.
Whether this meeting will prompt any U.S. action on the issue  of whether Moscow will be offered export bonus wheat is  uncertain, the aide said.
The USDA official said that as far as he knows there has  been no further action on offering the Soviet Union wheat under  the EEP.
