Current prospects for this year's  grain crop in Bulgaria and Romania appear less favorable than  in 1986, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Belgrade  said in a field report.
Fields seeded during the optimum period last fall, and  especially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about  65 pct of the fields observed), appeared to be in good  condition, with little evidence of winterkill, while others  varied considerably, the report said.
Spotty germination and winterkill in those  fields averaged 10 to 30 pct, it said.
