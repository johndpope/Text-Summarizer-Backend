House Ways and Means Committee  Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back  the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support.
He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a  number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought  a tax increase to help balance the budget.
Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his  1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax  increases.
This apparently ruled out congressional approval of another  textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as was  proposed again this year.
