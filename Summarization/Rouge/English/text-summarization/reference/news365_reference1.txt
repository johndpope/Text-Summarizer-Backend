Japanese importers bought some 95,000  tonnes of Chinese soybeans late last month for May to September  shipment, under the semi-annual trade accords, trade sources  said.
Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans, including spot  buying, may have totalled 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes of the 1986  crop for November to April 1987 shipment, down from some  300,000 tonnes the previous year, the sources said.
In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese  edible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers,  but low 1986 U.S. Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of  Chinese origin beans for crushing, they said.
