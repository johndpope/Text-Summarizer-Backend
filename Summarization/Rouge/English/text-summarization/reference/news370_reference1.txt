Gardini told Reuters the operation under consideration was  aimed at "international markets" and that the figure of 400 mln  dlrs given in some press reports "was probably about right."      European Sugar, wholly-owned by Ferruzzi unit Eridania  Zuccherifici Nazionali SpA, is expected to absorb the European  corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc which  Ferruzzi recently agreed to buy.
A Ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group was  studying the transfer of the CPC business to European Sugar  along with a possible share offering in the Paris unit, but  gave no details.
