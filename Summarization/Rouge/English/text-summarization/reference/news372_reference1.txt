Alcan Aluminium Ltd. in Montreal said  it increased yesterday its prices for unalloyed ingot and  extrusion billet by two cents a lb, effective with shipments  beginning May 1.
"We feel very confident about raising our prices because we  see demand over supply as being sustainable for some time,"  said Ian Rugeroni, Alcan's president of metal sales and  recycling - U.S.A.
Rugeroni said sheet and can bookings for Alcan aluminium  were up at a time when the company's total 1.1 mln tonne North  American smelter system had less than a week's supply.
