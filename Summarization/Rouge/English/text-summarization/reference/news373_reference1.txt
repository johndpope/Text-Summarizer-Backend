&lt;John Labatt Ltd> anticipates a good  fourth quarter and a new peak in sales and earnings for the  fiscal year ending April 30, president Peter Widdrington told  financial analysts.
Labatt's earnings rose to 92.8 mln dlrs in the nine months  ended January 31 from year-earlier 78 mln dlrs.
Widdrington said Labatt's three-year business plan, now  being updated, targets total sales of about six billion dlrs,  including 2.50 billion dlrs in the U.S.
Widdrington said Labatt's strategy for U.S. expansion  stemmed partly from its strong market position in the Canadian  food and beverage industry.
