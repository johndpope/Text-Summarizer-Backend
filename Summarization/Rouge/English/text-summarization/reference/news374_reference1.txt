Gold is expected to continue its rise  this year due to renewed inflationary pressures, especially in  the U.S., Hamburg-based Vereins- und Westbank AG said.
Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increased  industrial demand and higher expected coin production, the bank  said.
Speculative demand, which influences the gold price on  futures markets, has also risen, the bank said.
