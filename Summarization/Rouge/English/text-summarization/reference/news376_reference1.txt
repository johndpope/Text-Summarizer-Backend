A statement by the Preferential Trade Area (PTA), which  seeks to create a common market stretching from Ethiopia in the  north to Lesotho in the south, said the governments would make  the first tariff cut next year.
PTA sources said the agreement averted a split between  members wanting more progress towards free trade and weaker  states concerned about the effects on customs revenue.
The reductions cover only a common list of 300 or so widely  traded commodities and goods but PTA sources said the  organisation planned to expand the list to include 425 items.
