Sweden announced its promised program  of unilateral economic sanctions against South Africa and gave  firms an October deadline to cut trading links.
She said exceptions would also be granted in cases where a  Swedish trade boycott would benefit South African firms and  disadvantage South Africa's black-ruled neighbours, the  front-line states.
She said a  parliamentary committee would investigate ways of closing some  of the bigger loopholes, including indirect trade with South  Africa via Swedish subsidiaries in third countries.
