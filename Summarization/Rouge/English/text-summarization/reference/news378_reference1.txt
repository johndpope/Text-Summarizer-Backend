In the annual report, Chairman Robert Reuss told  shareholders telephone profits will continued to be limited by  ceilings imposed by regulators as well as deregulation and  structural changes within the industry that have slowed growth  in the investment base for setting rates.
"Several of the company's telephone units may be faced with  a reduction in the rates of return authorized by their  regulators," Reuss said.
"This could result in some rate  reductions and refunds to customers."      Reuss said he is encouraged by the prospects for progress  in Centel's business communications, cable television and  cellular telephone units.
