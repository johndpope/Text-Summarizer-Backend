The Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand  outlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese  energy demand, ministry officials said.
MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand  outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the  Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.
They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy  supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.
