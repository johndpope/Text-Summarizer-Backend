Penney said the agreement also calls for Beeba's, a major  supplier of junior sportswear, to work with Penny in the  establishment of junior specialty shops to be created in about  100 Penney stores in early 1988.
Penney said it will establish an independent merchandising  and marketing organization to manage and support the shops  which will be staffed by personnel both from within and outside  the company.
The company said the new agreement would have no impact on  its current supplier base and it will continue to work with as  braod base of suppliers of junior sportswear as it does in its  other merchandise areas.
