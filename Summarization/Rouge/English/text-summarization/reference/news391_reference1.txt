The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange  has expanded the normal daily trading limit in Coffee "C"  contracts to 6.0 cents a lb, from the previous 4.0 cents,  effective today, the CSCE said.
Before the rule change today, the CSCE required two days of  limit moves in the first three restricted contracts before  expanding the daily trading limit.
The expanded 9.0 cent limit will remain  in effect until the settling prices on both of the first two  limited months has not moved by more than the normal 6.0 cent  limit for other contracts in two successive trading sessions,  the CSCE said.
