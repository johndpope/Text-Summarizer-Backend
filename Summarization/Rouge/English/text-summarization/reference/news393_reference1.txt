Soviet imports of soymeal may reach or  exceed one mln tonnes between January and September this year,  the Oil World newsletter said.
At least 500,000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from the  European Community and South America in the January/March  quarter, with additional large quantities likely to be imported  in the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil, it  said.
The change made sense in view of the recent purchases of  probably 250,000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseed  and large scale butter imports that were expected from March  onward, it said.
