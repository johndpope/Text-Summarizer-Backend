FCS Laboratories Inc said merger  discussions with an unnamed privately-held company in the  health care field have ended without an agreement.
"But the discussions could not produce a deal  acceptable to our board in the context of the company's  stronger financial position today as compared to six months  ago."      Gallo said FCS will stop actively seeking potential merger  partners, but will respond to serious inquiries.
"To continue actively  searching for potential acquirers inherently forces us to  postpone the implementation of critical decisions which are  part of the plan."      The company, which has 4,475,930 common shares outstanding,  reaffirmed it expects to be profitable in the second half of  the fiscal year ending September 30, 1987.
