Brazil wants to increase its  steel exports to the United States, now limited because of  tough import restraints set in 1984 by the Reagan  administration, a spokeswoman for the Brazilian Steel Institute  (IBS) said.
The 1984 restraints established that for 1987 Brazil's  steel exports to the U.S. Could not exceed 632,000 tonnes,  increasing to 640,000 tonnes in 1988 and 670,000 tonnes in  1989, the last of the five-year deadline set by the agreements.
Brazilian officials are trying to increase Brazil's export  share of non-flat products to the U.S. Market.
