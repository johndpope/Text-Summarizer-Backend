Shares in Cable and Wireless Plc  &lt;CAWL.L> firmed in morning trading on market speculation that  its participation in a joint telecommunications venture in  Japan would not be curtailed, dealers said.
The dealers said the speculation appeared to originate in  Japan.
Cable has said it is resisting attempts by the  Federation of Economic Organisations to merge two Japan-based  telecommunications firms, a move which would have cut Cable's  stake from 20 pct in one to three pct in the merged unit.
British prime minister MargaretThatcher said in parliament  last week that she regarded Cable and Wireless's participation  in the Japanese venture as a test case of how open the Japanese  telecommunications market really was.
