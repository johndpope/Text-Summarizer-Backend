Sroka said world coffee prices are expected to remain weak  if any international coffee talks fail to produce agreement.
Sroka said stagnating consumption and slight overproduction  will continue to weigh on coffee prices and he forecast a  continued build-up in stocks.
Unless reason prevails and the major producers return to  the conference table, the world coffee market will remain free  and the consequences for some producers dependant on coffee for  their foreign exchange earnings would be catastrophic, Sroka  added.
