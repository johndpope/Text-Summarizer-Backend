Dutch seasonally adjusted unemployment  rose in the month to end-March to a total 693,000 from 690,600  at end-February, but was well down from 730,100 at end-March  1986, Social Affairs Ministry figures show.
The figure for male jobless rose by 2,000 in the month to  436,500 compared with 470,700 a year earlier.
A ministry spokesman said the unadjusted figures showed a  smaller than usual seasonal decrease for the time of year,  because of particularly cold weather delaying work in the  building industry.
A year earlier the figure was 28,763.
