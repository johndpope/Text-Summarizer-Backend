The Development Bank of Singapore Ltd  (DBS) said Malaysia's real gross domestic product growth (gdp)  in 1987 could be 1.5 to two pct, above a budget target of one  pct.
It forecast the ringgit will remain stable at between 2.60  and 2.70 Malaysian dlrs to the U.S. Dollar for the rest of the  year.
But the report said the growth rate of Malaysia's external  debt remains worrying and should be controlled.
