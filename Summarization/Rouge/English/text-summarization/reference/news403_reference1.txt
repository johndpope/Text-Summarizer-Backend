Shifts from mild to very cold  weather in East Germany damaged winter barley and late sown  winter wheat in central regions and barley north of Berlin, the  U.S. agricultural officer in East Berlin said.
He said the damage was probably more limited in southern  and central regions and most widespread in the north.
Damage was most severe on plants above the ground where  little or no snow cover was present, he added.
The officer said repairing damage will probably call for  special measures this spring in fields with damaged plants and  where stands are thin.
