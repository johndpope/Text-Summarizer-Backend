Negotiations between Indonesia's state  oil company Pertamina and foreign oil contractors on extension  of the standard 30-year production sharing contract will be  concluded by the end of this month, a Pertamina official said.
Jukardi, speaking to Indonesian reporters, said the  negotiations would determine whether the 85-15 production  sharing split in favour of Pertamina would be adhered to or  altered in some cases as oil companies are asking for.
