French 1987 growth will probably be about  two pct, the same as last year, due to an international  environment that is less favourable than expected, Finance  Minister Edouard Balladur was quoted as saying.
Last month Balladur said French GDP had grown by just two  pct last year, compared with an initial 1986 target of 2.5 pct  and 1.1 pct growth in 1985.
He told Les Echos he aims to reduce the 1988 budget deficit  to 115 billion francs from this year's figure of 129 billion  and compared with a 141 billion deficit in 1985.
