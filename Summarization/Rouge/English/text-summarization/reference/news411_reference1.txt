Chemical Bank and Marine Midland Banks  Inc said they are cutting their prime lending rate to 9-1/4 pct  from 9-3/4 pct, reversing an increase that they announced just  last week.
No other major U.S. bank had followed the lead of Chemical  and Marine Midland, preferring to keep their prime rates at  9-1/4 pct while they waited to see what course money market  rates would take.
Following Monday's record fall in Wall Street stock prices,  money market rates fell sharply on Tuesday as investors  ploughed proceeds into short-term instruments and the Federal  Reserve said it is prepared to provide liquidity to support the  economy and the financial system.
