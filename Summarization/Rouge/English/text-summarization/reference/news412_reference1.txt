Cocoa futures fell to session lows by  midmorning, posting losses from last night of six to two stg a  tonne in 1987 deliveries, dealers said.
Dealers said the market was switch and straddle-bound, in  that any pressure on one particular month was certain to be  reflected in adjacent deliveries.
The market was originally forecast to open with average  five stg gains from last night following New York's firmer  close yesterday, dealers said.
Near July traded at its session low of 1,327 stg after one  hour versus 1,333 bid last night and an early high of 1,335.
