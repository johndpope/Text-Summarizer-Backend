E.A. Viner Holdings Ltd said the earlier  reported Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of Heck's Inc &lt;HEX>, in  which Viner holds 408,000 shares, would not materially affect  Viner's capital position or its ability to carry on its  profitable brokerage business.
The company said Heck's Chapter 11 filing could, however,  affect Viner's previously reported legal action to recover  costs from an aborted merger agreement with Heck's.
Viner earlier reported a fourth quarter loss of 918,000  U.S. dlrs after a 1.5 mln dlr writedown of its stake in Heck's.
The full-year earnings  included a 900,000 dlr net writedown of the Heck's stake, it  said.
