Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita  said there is little room left for the central bank to further  ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now  approaching their lower limit.
His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic  stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming  days.
At the recent talks among the six major industrialised  nations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive  economic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn would  help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus.
