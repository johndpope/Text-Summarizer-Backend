Ecuador today suspended its crude oil  exports indefinitely due to an earthquake last night that  damaged pumping and crude transport installations, an Energy  and Mines MInistry statement said.
A senior energy ministry official said that one pumping  station at El Salado on Ecuador's main pipeline was damaged.
The pumping station was about 20 km from the Reventador  volcano, near the epicentre of the quake, which Ecuadorean  seismologists said registered six on the 12-point international  Mercalli scale.
The Aguarico bridge was also close to the  volcano, he said.
