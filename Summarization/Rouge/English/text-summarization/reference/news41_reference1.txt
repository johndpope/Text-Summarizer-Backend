Malaysian miners criticised the  U.S. For violating an agreement with Southeast Asian producers  by selling more stockpiled tin in 1986 than agreed.
The U.S. General Services Administration sold 5,490 tonnes  of tin in 1986, well above an agreed upon annual limit of 3,000  tonnes, the States of Malaya Chamber of Mines said.
In its latest annual report, it said the U.S. Had promised  to limit sales of tin in a memorandum of understanding signed  with the six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN) in December 1983.
