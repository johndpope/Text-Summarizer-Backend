France's Economic and Social Council  (CES), an advisory body comprising industrialists, trade  unionists and representatives of other sectors of the French  economy, said the country's annual growth may not reach two pct  in 1987.
French gross domestic product risks not reaching the two  pct growth registered last year, the Council said in a report  on first quarter 1987 economic activity without giving any  specific forecasts.
Balladur said in an interview with the financial daily Les  Echos that the country's economic growth will probably be about  the same as last year due to a less favourable international  environment.
