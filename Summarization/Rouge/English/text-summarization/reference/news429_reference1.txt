Reed International Plc &lt;REED.L> denied  rumours on the U.K. Stock market that it was the target of a  takeover bid and said it had received no approach.
"In view of the increase in our share price today, I want to  make clear that we have not received any bid approaches," Reed's  chairman Leslie Carpenter said in a statement.
Share market analysts said speculators were buying the  stock on belief that Harcourt would bid for Reed in an effort  to escape the unwelcome two billion dlr bid from Robert  Maxwell's British Printing and Communication Corp &lt;BPCL.L>.
