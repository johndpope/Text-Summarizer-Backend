Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul  Volcker said a restrictive monetary policy would be damaging to  investment and that a better course would be to restrain  spending.
In response to a question about banks, Volcker said he  would be pleased if Congress decided to give banks a tax  writeoff as an incentive for them to take greater reserves  against loans to debtor countries.
"If you give a tax writeoff for reserving against loans,  then we will see more reserving and that would make me happy,"  Volcker told Committee Chairman Sen William Proxmire (D-Wisc).
