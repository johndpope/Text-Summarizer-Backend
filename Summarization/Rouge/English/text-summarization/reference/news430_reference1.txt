J.C. Penney Co's stock rose sharply   after analyst William Smith of Smith Barney recommended the  stock, based on the company's strong earnings momentum and the  possibility of a stock buyback, dividend hike or stock split,  traders said.
Smith said the company ended 1986 with a strong cash  position of about 639 mln dlrs as compared to 158 mln dlrs the  year before.
"This implies the possibility of a share buyback,  or significant dividend increase or a stock split," he said.
