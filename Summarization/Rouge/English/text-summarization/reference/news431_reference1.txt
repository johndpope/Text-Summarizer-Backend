The company said it expects to report "strong earnings per  share growth and a record return on equity in fiscal 1987." It  said this should be achieved despite expected non-operating  charges in the final quarter.
General Mills said these charges will likely offset  non-operating gains, which included six cts a share in the  first half.
General Mills said at the end of the third quarter, its  return on average equity was 31.6 pct.
The company reported quarterly earnings of 56.9 mln dlrs,  or 64 cts a share, up from 46.4 mln dlrs, or 52 cts a share a  year ago.
