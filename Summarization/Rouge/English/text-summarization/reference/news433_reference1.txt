Dutch chemicals group Akzo  NV &lt;AKZO.AS> said it hoped to consolidate its core activities  this year by making small acquisitions in the US.
Despite its highly liquid cash flow, Akzo did not plan  acquisitions on a scale that would negatively influence the  company's debt/equity ratio, Loudon said.
The chairman said in the past two years Akzo had spent 1.1  billion guilders on acquisitions, of which nearly two thirds  were in the United States.
