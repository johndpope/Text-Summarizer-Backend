Stad Rotterdam chairman Lucas van Leeuwen told Reuters it  may raise its stake to a majority interest if the two companies  are found to be sufficiently compatible.
Van Leeuwen said that due partly to the fact Europeesche  made losses in 1985 and 1986, the 20 pct stake was obtained at  below the shares' intrinsic value.
Stad Rotterdam's premium income in 1986 was 1.17 billion  guilders, making it the fifth largest Dutch insurer.
Europeesche made a loss of nine mln guilders in 1985, which  narrowed to 4.5 mln guilders in 1986, van Leeuwen said.
