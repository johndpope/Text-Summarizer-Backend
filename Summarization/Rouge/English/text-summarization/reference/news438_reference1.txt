Kansas Republican Congressman Pat  Roberts urged the Reagan administration to offer export  enhancement program, eep, subsidies to the Soviet Union.
Speaking at a House foreign agriculture subcommittee,  Roberts said the U.S. has offered eep to China and Poland, and  should also include the Soviet Union.
Rep. Roberts said there had been some talk that the issue  of an eep to Moscow had not been raised within the Reagan  administration recently because Secretary of State George  Shultz was out of the country.
Rep. Roberts urged Kay to convey to top officials of the  USDA that some in Congress favor a wheat eep to Moscow.
