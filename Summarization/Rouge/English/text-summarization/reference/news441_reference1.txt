Brazil's state-oil company  Petrobras has asked the Army to withdraw the troops which were  occupying its oil installations since Tuesday, Petrobras said  in a statement.
"The request was also due to the end of the seamen's strike  and the willingness of the oil industry workers to sit again by  the negotiating table," the statement said.
Even though the Petrobras statement said the seamen's  strike was over, a union spokesman said only two small shipping  companies had reached a pay agreement.
