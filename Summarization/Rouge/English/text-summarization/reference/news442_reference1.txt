Alcan said it and Bertone have built several Bertone X1/9  sports cars with structures of adhesively bonded sheet  aluminum.
It said the bodies were made on presses used for  Bertone's steel-structured sports cars.
Alcan said it has developed and tested the aluminum  structure technology so that it is suitable for modern auto  making methods and plants.
The structure provides the same stiffness and safety as  present materials, while continuously bonded seams allow a 65  pct reduction in spot welds, Alcan said.
