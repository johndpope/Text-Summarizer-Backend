The Environmental Protection Agency's  five to 10 mln dlr suit against a Browning-Ferris Industries  Inc &lt;BFI> unit, CECOS International Inc, caused the stock to  drop today, analysts said.
"What investors are actually saying by selling off some BFI  shares is the cloud over this industry is the threat that the  EPA will get tough on waste management companies," Willard  Brown, senior analyst for First Albany Corp.
"Investors are saying to themselves that waste management  companies have that kind of exposure to regulatory suits,"  Brown said.
Brown said if the suit were settled for 10 mln dlrs  it would have an impact on Browning Ferris earnings.
