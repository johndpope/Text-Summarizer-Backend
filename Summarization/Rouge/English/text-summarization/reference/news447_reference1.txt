Gold is expected to continue its rise  this year due to renewed inflationary pressures, especially in  the U.S., Hamburg-based Vereins- und Westbank AG said.
Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increased  industrial demand and higher expected coin production, the bank  said.
These factors and South  Africa's unstable political situation, which may lead to a  temporary reduction in gold supplies from that country,  underline the firmer sentiment, it said.
