The Paris-based Intergovernmental Council  of Copper Exporting Countries (CIPEC) is closely studying the  current backwardation in world copper market prices but does  not envisage taking corrective action at present, CIPEC sources  here said.
The organisation's executive and marketing committees  reviewed the current market situation during a series of  meetings here late last week, but took no major decisions.
Their main aim was to prepare the ground for the annual  ministerial meeting of CIPEC, which is scheduled for Zaire in  late September.
