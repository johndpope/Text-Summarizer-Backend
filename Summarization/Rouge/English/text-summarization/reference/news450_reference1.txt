The leaders of two of Japan's top business  groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7)  accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to  Japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the  yen's current level as appropriate.
Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren), said the yen's present rate is well  above adequate levels.
Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for  Economic Development, said the accord will not prevent the yen  from rising further.
Saito called on each G-7 member nation to prepare to  intervene in the market strongly enough to ensure exchange  rates are stabilised at appropriate levels.
