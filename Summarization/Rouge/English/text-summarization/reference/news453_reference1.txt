Taiwan said it would soon relax import  controls on some 400 foreign items, including stationery and  books, in a further effort to allow trading partners,  especially the U.S., Greater access to its markets.
The island's trade surplus  reached a record 15.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year, up from  10.62 billion in 1985.
Washington is pressing Taiwan to open its markets wider as  a way of cutting its trade deficit with the island, which rose  to 2.35 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from  1.87 billion in the year-earlier period.
