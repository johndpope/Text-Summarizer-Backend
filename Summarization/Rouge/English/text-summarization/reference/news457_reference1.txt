Negotiators at a United Nations  conference on natural rubber are making slow progress towards  reaching an agreement, delegates said.
The conference, which began Monday, is widely seen as the  final effort to adopt a new International Natural Rubber  Agreement (INRA) before the current one expires in October.
Delegates said both sides still appeared divided on the key  issue of the price adjustment mechanism.
Consumers want frequent price reviews at 12 month intervals  instead of 18 months as at present, a proposal currently  rejected by producers.
