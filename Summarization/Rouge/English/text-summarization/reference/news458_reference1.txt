SNC, Canada's second biggest engineering and construction  group, became the country's largest ammunition manufacturer  last year with its 90 mln dlr acquisition of Canadian Arsenals  Ltd from the Canadian government.
Defense preoducts and other manufacturing operations will  account for more than half SNC's total 1987 revenues, helping  to counterbalance the more cyclical engineering and  construction acivities, Taylor said.
In 1987, a total manufacturing activities will generate  about 235 mln dlrs in revenues, and engineering and  construction about 200 mln dlrs, he said, adding that defense  products operations should be a major contributor to earnings.
