Japan is disappointed at the recent threats  of trade retaliation from the European Community (EC) just as  the trade situation between the two is improving, Japanese  Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura said.
"I feel this is a strong step on the road to balance through  expansion."      "While I do not deny the existence of the trade deficit  between Japan and the EC, I believe it should be rectified not  by reducing trade through import restrictions or export  restraints, but by expanding the (overall) trade," Tamura said.
