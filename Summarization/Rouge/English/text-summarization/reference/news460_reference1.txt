The outcome of negotiations on  proposals by the European Commission for a 330 Ecus a tonne tax  on EC-produced and imported oilseeds and marine oils remains  difficult to predict, Belgian agriculture minister Paul de  Keersmaeker told a news conference.
De Keersmaeker, who chaired a meeting of EC farm ministers  which ended today, was asked about reports enough countries  were against the tax to ensure that it would be defeated in  negotiations on the EC farm price package for 1987/88.
"I think there is room for negotiations, and I would not  want to make any predictions at this stage," de Keersmaeker  said.
