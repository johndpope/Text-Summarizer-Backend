A Colombian group announced the suspension  of its bombings of oil pipelines pending the government's levy  of a social tax on foreign petroleum companies and an 800 mln  dlrs fine on the Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY>.
In a communique, the ELN said it would demand a tax of one  dollar per barrel of crude oil pumped by foreign firms as a  condition for maintaining its suspension of the assaults.
Foreign oil firms pump an average of 225,083 barrels per  day in Colombia.
If the charges are proven, the firm could face a fine of up  to 800 mln dlrs.
