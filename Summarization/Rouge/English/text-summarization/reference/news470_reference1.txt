Burma's debt service ratio will have  fallen to 48.8 pct in the fiscal year to end-March 1987 from 50  pct in 1985-1986, the official Council of People's Inspectors  (CPI) reported.
Western diplomats in Rangoon estimate the figure at above  70 pct and say the country can no longer depend on foreign  exchange reserves to cover more than a few weeks' imports.
Debt servicing cost Burma 1.62 billion kyats in 1985-1986  while foreign exchange earnings -- export revenues plus loans  and aid -- totalled 3.23 billion kyats in the same period, the  council said.
