The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the  fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986  cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the  value of the dollar, the institute said in a report.
Provisional inflation figures for February released last  week showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower  than in February 1986.
The HWWA said its forecast assumed the dollar would remain  around 1.80 marks and oil prices would range between 15 and 17  dlrs per barrel.
