&lt;Spar Aerospace Ltd>, reporting a  sharply lower 1986 profit, said it anticipated solid profit and  revenue growth during the next five years.
"Looking to the longer term, Spar is confident that its  continuing concentration on advanced robotics, satellite-based  communications and electro-optical defense systems will lead to  significant growth in revenues and earnings over the next five  years," the company said.
Spar added that lower development costs in the  communications group and a return to normal operations in gears  and transmissions and aviation services "will remove a serious  drain on profits" this year.
