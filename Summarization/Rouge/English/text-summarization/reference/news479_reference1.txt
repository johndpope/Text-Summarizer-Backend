The recent deterioration in the  steel market makes it important for Arbed SA &lt;ARBB.BR> to  maintain efforts to reduce costs, the company said in a  statement.
Arbed said the early months of 1987 had seen the market  deteriorate further, but the decision of the European Community  to maintain anti-crisis measures, at least provisionally,  should under normal circumstances have a beneficial effect.
Arbed said in current conditions, cost cutting efforts  remain necessary to avoid any weakening of resources which have  been built up over the last three years.
