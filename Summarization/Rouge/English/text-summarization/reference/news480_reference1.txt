The mineral interests will include Asamera's 51 pct  interest in the Cannon gold mine in Wenatchee, Wash.
Asamera said its talks with Breakwater Resources Ltd  &lt;BWRLF> on a possible merger of mining interests, including the  Cannon mine, have been terminated.
Asamera said holding all its mineral properties in a  separate company will give better and more direct recognition  to the value of the assets.
