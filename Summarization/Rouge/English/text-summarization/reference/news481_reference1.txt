All this produce will be imported into Spain at special  levy levels likely to be below those applying for imports into  other EC countries.
The sources said it was possible that the Spanish  intervention board would be asked to buy the produce directly  this year, as it was rather late to make other arrangements.
There will initially be no tax on re-exports of maize and  sorghum from Spain to other EC countries, although such a tax  could be imposed later, the sources added.
