The European Community (EC) farmers'  and farm cooperatives lobbies, Copa and Cogeca, have backed the  EC Commission plan for an oils and fats price stabilisation  mechanism, claiming it would not harm consumers.
In a letter to Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans,  current president of the EC Council of Ministers, they said the  mechanism, often referred to as a tax, would in fact subsidise  oils and fats prices in the EC under some circumstances.
The mechanism would provide for this tax to be reduced, and  possibly to become a subsidy, as world soya oil prices rose  from present levels.
