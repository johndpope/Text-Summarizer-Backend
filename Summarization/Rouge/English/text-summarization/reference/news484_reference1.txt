A company spokesman said 1986 results were boosted  significantly by the booking of two large orders for nuclear  power plants.
This gain, he said, will be balanced in 1987 by a return to  profitability by Asea's power transmission segment, which had a  loss of 183 mln crowns, or 26.9 mln dlrs, last year.
The spokesman said the company has built up a strong  backlog of orders that will contribute to earnings in 1988 and  beyond.
At yearend 1986, Asea's order backlog stood at 32.7 billion  crowns, or 4.8 billion dlrs, up from 30.9 billion, or 4.5  billion dlrs, at the end of 1985.
