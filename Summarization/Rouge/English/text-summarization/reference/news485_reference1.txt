About 14,000 of Brazil's 40,000  seamen are now back at work after pay accords with 21 shipping  companies but the rest are still on strike, a spokesman at  strike headquarters said today.
The spokesman, talking by telephone from Rio de Janeiro,  said 126 ships were strike-bound.
He added that because of resignations by many seamen there  were scarcely any crews left on 38 of these ships.
Economic analysts added, however, that any delay to exports  served to aggravate Brazil's balance of payments crisis, which  last month prompted the government to suspend interest payments  on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt.
