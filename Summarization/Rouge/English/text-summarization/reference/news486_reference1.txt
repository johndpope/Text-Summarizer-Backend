The group said action by Japan to cut back on semiconductor  exports is not what is required.
"America's interests require that agreements be honored and  that U.S. industries not bear the burden for the persistent  unwillingness or inability of the government of Japan to  deliver on its commitments," the trade group said.
The trade group said Japan has not lived up to the terms of  the agreement last year which was aimed at ending Japanese  dumping of semiconductors and at opening Japanese markets to  foreign-based manufacturers.
