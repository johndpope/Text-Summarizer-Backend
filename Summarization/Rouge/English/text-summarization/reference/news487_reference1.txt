Bank of England governor Robin  Leigh-Pemberton said lowering interest rates too fast could  jeopardise recent economic achievements in the U.K.
"It would surely be foolish to put that favourable  conjuncture at risk by lowering interest rates prematurely or  excessively," he said.
Leigh-Pemberton said he recognised there are some who would  argue that interest rates are still too high and deter  investment in industry.
