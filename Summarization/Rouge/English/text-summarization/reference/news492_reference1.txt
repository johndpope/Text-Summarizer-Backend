Greece and Turkey's NATO allies today  called on both countries to avoid any action that could  aggravate an explosive situation in the Aegean and "avoid  recourse to force at all costs."      After an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors, a statement  was issued saying "the present situation damages the interests  of Greece and Turkey, and of the Alliance as a whole."      Secretary-General Lord Carrington also offered himself as a  mediator in the dispute on the Western Alliance's southern  flank.
The statement said the tensions in the area had reached a  serious level and called on both countries to begin immediate  discussions.
Carrington said,  "I am of course anxious to help in any way I can, provided that  both Greece and Turkey, and the other allies, wish me to do so."
