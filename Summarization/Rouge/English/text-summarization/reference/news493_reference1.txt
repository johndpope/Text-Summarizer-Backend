Colombia, the only major latin american country not to have  rescheduled its external public debt, has a total foreign debt  of 13.6 billion dlrs.
Gaviria said lower  coffee prices this year could mean a loss of 1.5 billion dlrs  in revenues for 1987.
Gaviria submitted to the world bank and the inter-american  bank last week in new york a borrowing plan, for a total of  3.054 billion dlrs to be disbursed over the next four years,  which he said was approved.
