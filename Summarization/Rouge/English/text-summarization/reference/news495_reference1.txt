While the measure does not bind Reagan to any action,  Senate leaders said its adoption would warn Japan stiffer  legislation would be considered if the violations continue.
"We want to send a message to Japan to let it know how the  Senate feels about this matter," Senate Democratic Leader Robert  Byrd told the Senate.
Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen told the  Senate the measure was not aimed at retaliation but at  correcting Japan's unfair trade practices.
