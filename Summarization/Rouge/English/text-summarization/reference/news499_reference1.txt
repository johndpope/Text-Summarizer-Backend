Leading cocoa producers will discuss  whether newly-agreed rules on an international cocoa buffer  stock will succeed in reversing a sharp fall in world prices  when they start four day's of talks here later today,  conference sources said.
Another topic likely to be discussed at the twice-yearly  meeting of the Cocoa Producer Alliance (CPA) is the pact's  second line of market support -- a witholding scheme under  which exporters can take up to 120,000 tonnes of cocoa off the  market if buffer stock purchases fail to defend prices.
