Centronics Corp said its board  declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share  purchase right on each outstanding common share payable to  holders of record April 9.
If the rights become exercisable, the company said, those  held by shareholders other than the owner of 30 pct or more of  the stock will entitle the holder to purchase a number of  common shares having a market value twice the right's exercise  price.
