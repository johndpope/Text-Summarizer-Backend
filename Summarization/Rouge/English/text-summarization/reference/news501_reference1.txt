Beaver Creek State Bank in Beaver  Creek, Minn., failed and the bank's insured assets were  transferred to Citizens State Bank of Silver Lake, Minn., the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Separately, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Victor  Federal Savings and Loan Association of Muskogee, Okla., was  placed into receivership.
The transfer was arranged because there were no bids to buy  Beaver Creek, the FDIC said.
Citizens will pay a premium of 30,000 dlrs  to the FDIC and  purchase Beaver Creek's assets for 5.3 mln dlrs.
The FHLBB said Victor Federal Savings was insolvent and its  assets were transferred to a newly chartered federal mutual  association with directors named by the FHLBB.
