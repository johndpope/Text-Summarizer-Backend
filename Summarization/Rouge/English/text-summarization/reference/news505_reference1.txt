Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc  said it has told Harper and Row Publishers Inc representatives  that it intends to withdraw its proposal to acquire Harper and  Row for 50 dlrs per share in cash if the parties have not made  satisfactory progress in discussions by the close of business  on March 30.
Harcourt Brace said it will only pursue the acquisition if  a mutually-satisfactory merger agreement can be negotiated.
Last week, a group formed by Theodore Cross offered to  acquire Harper and Row for 34 dlrs per share.
