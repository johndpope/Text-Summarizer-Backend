Eastman Kodak Co said it has  acquired an 18.7 pct equity interest in Enzon Inc, a  pharmaceutical company specializing in protein therapy.
Kodak said it secured worldwide marketing rights for three  of Enzon's PEG enzymes used in the treatment of oxygen toxicity  disorders, hyperuricemia and gout.
The drugs are PEG-superoxide disdmutase and PEG-catalase,  for use against oxygen toxicity disorders that cause the  often-fatal tissue damage associated with severe burns, organ  transplants, heart attacks and trauma, and PEG-uricase, for  treatment of gout and other conditions caused by the buildup of  high levels of uric acid in the body.
