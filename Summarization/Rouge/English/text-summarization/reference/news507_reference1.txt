The Bank of France said in its latest  monthly report on the French economy it expected a pickup in  industrial production registered in March to gather steam over  the next few months.
Without giving figures, the report said last month's rise,  partly linked to efforts to catch up with production lost  earlier this year through industrial action, was due mainly to  a firming of domestic demand.
While the automobile industry remained unchanged from  previously boosted levels, consumer goods production grew and  was expected to accelerate except in the area of domestic  appliances.
