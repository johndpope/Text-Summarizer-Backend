Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige  said the United States will not stand idly by and let Japan  dominate the world electronics market.
Baldrige told the Senate Finance Committee the United  States would insist Japan open its markets to U.S. products as  the U.S. market is open to Japanese products.
"I can only conclude that the common objective of the  Japanese government and industry is to dominate the world  electronics market.
