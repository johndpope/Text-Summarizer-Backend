The United States said it was doing  what it could to ease tension in the Aegean as Greek and  Turkish warships headed for a possible clash over oil drilling  rights on the sea's continental shelf.
Redman declined to elaborate on what Washington was doing,  but he said an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors in  Brussels on the subject was only one path it was pursuing.
He also refused to say which side was to blame for the  renewed confrontation, saying Washington was still trying to  ascertain all the facts, as Prime minister Andreas Papanderou  said Greece was prepared to tackle any aggressor.
