U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker  said an agreement has been reached by members of the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to  control the unfair trade practice of using tied aid to promote  trade.
He said in a statement the agreement culminates the Reagan  administration's effot to negotiate a virtual end to export  credit subsidies.
It would also reduce export credits that do not involve aid  and reduce credit subsidies permitted for relatively poor  countries, the Treasury said.
