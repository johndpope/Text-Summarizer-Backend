Japan was ready to use diplomacy to help  maintain the security of the Gulf, Prime Minister Yasuhiro  Nakasone said.
Officials of the foreign ministry  said Japan had maintained good relations with both Iran and  Iraq, which have been at war since September 1980.
Last week Nakasone ruled out Japanese military or financial  help to patrol the waters of the Gulf.
President Reagan said yesterday the threat to oil routes in  the Gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq was high on the agenda  for next week's G-7 summit in Venice.
