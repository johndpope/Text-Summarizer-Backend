Members unanimously rejected the latest company offer that  was submitted to the union late last week.
An overwhelming  majority of the approximately 2,500 members attending the  meeting then voted to go on strike, UFCW union spokesman Allen  Zack said.
IBP's latest offer included wage cuts of 60 cents an hour  for slaughter operations and a 45 cents an hour cut in pay for  processing workers.
The cut follows the 1.07 dlr cut in pay  workers received in 1982 and the wage freeze that has lasted  since then, Zack said.
