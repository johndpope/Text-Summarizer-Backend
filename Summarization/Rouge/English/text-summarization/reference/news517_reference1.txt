Spanish farm minister Carlos Romero,  speaking at a meeting of EC farm ministers, called for action  to help the Spanish maize market, Spanish diplomatic sources  said.
Spain is threatened with massive imports from third  countries by the end of the year, they said.
The sources said Romero urged that other EC countries  should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the  Spanish market.
