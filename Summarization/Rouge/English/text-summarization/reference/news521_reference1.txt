Cuban president Fidel Castro told a  Congress of the Union of Young Communists here that the  production of crude sugar during the harvest still in progress  is 800,000 tonnes behind schedule.
Neither Castro nor the Cuban press have given out figures  to estimate tonnes of crude production during the present  harvest or the goals for the sugar campaign.
However, a cuban sugar official told Reuters that the  country will be lucky if crude output reaches last year's 7.2  mln tonnes.
