The tin price is likely to rise to  20 ringgit a kilo this year because of the producers' accord on  export quotas and the reluctance of brokers and banks to sell  the metal at lower prices, a Malaysian government bulletin  said.
The Malaysian Tin bulletin said it is in producers'  interest to keep to their quotas to limit total exports to  90,000 tonnes and to gradually deplete the 80,000 tonnes  overhang.
The continued depreciation of the dollar could also help  push up the price of tin, the bulletin said.
