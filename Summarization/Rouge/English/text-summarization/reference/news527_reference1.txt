American lawmakers rallied behind  President Reagan for the U.S. strike against Iranian targets in  the Gulf but the attack fueled a sharp new White House-Congress  debate over limits on his powers to make war.
Many Democrats, who control Congress, and Republicans  expressed support for the attack and praised it as an  appropriate "measured response."      But Democrats and liberal Republicans voiced new fears that  the growing confrontation between Tehran and the United States  could erupt into a major war, and demanded that Reagan comply  with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of  American forces from the waterway.
