"The parties agreed to continue economic  cooperation under the Louvre agreement and its flexible  application including cooperation on exchange rate stability  and monetary policies," the Treasury said.
The Treasury said Baker and Stoltenberg "are consulting with  their G-7 colleagues and are confident that this will enable  them to foster exchange rate stability around current levels."      The Louvre pact is an agreement between the Group of Seven  leading industrial countries including the United States and  West Germany to promote currency stability.
