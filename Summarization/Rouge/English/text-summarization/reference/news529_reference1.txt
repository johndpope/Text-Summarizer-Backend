The company also said it expects to report a 10 mln dlrs  net gain in the quarter from excess pension funds used to pay  down debt.
"However, it is difficult to determine now whether  this gain will be sufficient to offset the expected operating  loss," the company said in a statement.
The company's Ashland Petroleum Co unit operated at a loss  in January and February since it was unable to raise product  prices enough to recover higher crude oil costs, Ashland said.
Although Ashland Petroleum and SuperAmerica, a retail  marketing operation, are having a difficult quarter, the  company's Valvoline, Ashland Chemical and coal businesses are  expected to report good results for the quarter ended March 31.
