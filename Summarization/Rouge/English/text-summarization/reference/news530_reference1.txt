After an extraordinary expense associated with the  December, 1986 withdrawal of a planned common share offering,  "we expect to be modestly profitable for the year, but below the  410,000 dlrs earned in fiscal 1986," the company said.
The company said it anticipated fiscal 1987 earnings to be  lower due to withdrawal of its share offering, computer  equipment shipment delays and costs associated with sales staff  expansion.
