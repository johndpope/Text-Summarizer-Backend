U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm  Baldrige predicted Congress will pass a reasonable trade bill  this year and said tough protectionist legislation could prompt  a trade war.
"The mood of the Congress right now is as tough on trade as  I've ever seen it in six years in Washington," Baldrige said in  a weekend television interview.
When asked if there is a rising danger of a worldwide trade  war, Baldrige said: "Yes, I don't think there's any question  about that."
