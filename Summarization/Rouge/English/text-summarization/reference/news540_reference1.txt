Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said he  was surprised by recent criticism of West German economic  policies voiced by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker but  added that the criticism was not purely one-sided.
Stoltenberg told the West German Trade and Industry  Association (DIHT) that before a meeting with Baker on Monday,  "There had been surprising notes of criticism (from the United  States)." He added.
Stoltenberg told the DIHT that his meeting on Monday with  Baker had resolved differences between the two countries.
