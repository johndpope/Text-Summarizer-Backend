MMAL, 99 pct-owned by Mitsubishi Motors Corp &lt;MIMT.T> and  Mitsubishi Corp &lt;MITT.T>,  said a tight market meant it had  failed to recover 19 mln dlrs in costs sustained because of a  weak Australian dollar.
The company said its Magna car dominated its market segment  with sales of 30,500 units against 26,900 in 1985.
Imported passenger car, light commercial and heavy vehicle  sales suffered while local-manufacturing profitability was  eroded by sales substantially below production capacity, it  said.
Australian car sales fell to 530,000 in 1985 from 696,000  in 1985, although MMAL said it lifted its market penetration to  12.1 pct from 11.5 pct.
