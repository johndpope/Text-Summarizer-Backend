He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos sur  Mer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investment  over 1985-86 and had last year broken even after stock losses.
The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity  of seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer's is five mln, the  spokesman added.
Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would  be Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery, while the Port  Jerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a  petrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant.
Raymond was quoted as saying in a published interview that  Exxon was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might  decide to close one of its French refineries.
