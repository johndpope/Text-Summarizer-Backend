"This allows the exchange and its members to concentrate our  marketing on the pig and live cattle contracts," LMFE official  Peter Freeman said.
Some 131 pig contracts were settled against the Meat and  Livestock Commission's Average All Pigs Price in February,  which represents hedging for over 13,000 pigs, more than twice  the number cash-settled in January, the LMFE said.
Cash settlement on the new cattle and pig contracts was  introduced last June in the expectation that the appeal of the  futures market to farmers, abattoirs and users of meat would  increase because of the absence of a delivery requirement.
