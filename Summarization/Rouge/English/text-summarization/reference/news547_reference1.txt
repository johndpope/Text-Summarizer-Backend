USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes, up one  mln from last month's estimate and 700,000 tonnes below the  preliminary 1985/86 figure.
Record or near-record livestock inventories, along with  a dry fall which likely reduced late season pasturage, and a  cold winter have increased feed demand, USDA said.
