The West German government expressed  support for the U.S. Position in opposing the proposed European  Community tax on vegetable oils and fats, a U.S. Embassy  spokesman said.
The spokesman, speaking from Bonn, said, "We have good  reason to think West Germany holds to its resistance to the  proposed tax."      Several top government officials told the American Soybean  Association and the National Soybean Processors Association  delegations there was no reason for American producers and  processors to pay for EC agriculture, the spokesman said.
