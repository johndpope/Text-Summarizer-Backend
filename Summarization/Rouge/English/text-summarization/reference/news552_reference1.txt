Dixons Group PLC said it does not plan  to extend the expiration date of its tender offer for any and  all common shares of Cyclops Corp beyond tonight.
Dixons, which is offering 90.25 dlrs a share for Cyclops,  said last week it had about 54 pct of Cyclops common shares.
Citicorp said yesterday that its proposal would allow  Dixons to raise its tender price to 93.25 dlrs per share.
Citicorp said if Dixons accepted the proposal, CYACQ would  terminate its competing 92.50 dlr offer for Cyclops.
