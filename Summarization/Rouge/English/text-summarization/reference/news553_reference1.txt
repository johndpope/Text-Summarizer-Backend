The United Food And Commercial  Workers said that more than 1,000 rank-and-file members of the  union will demonstrate Monday at Dart Group Corp's headquarters  protesting Dart's proposed 1.73 billion dlr takover of  Supermarkets General &lt;SGL>.
The union said that it is firmly against the Dart bid  because "workers have always ended up with a raw deal in the  current takeover mania."      A Union statement said: "We do not intend to allow our  members to pick up the tab for Supermarket General's executives  and the bankers or the Dart Group who stand to make millions."      Dart is controlled by the Haft family of Washington, which  last year made a bid for California-based Safeway Stores Inc.
