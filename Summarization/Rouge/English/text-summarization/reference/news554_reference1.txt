The Papua New Guinea Government  will establish a public corporation to invest in resources  projects, Minerals and Energy Minister John Kaputin said.
Kaputin said Papua New Guinea was experiencing a boom with  exploration companies spending about 60 mln kina annually on  about 150 mining and 23 petroleum projects.
Kaputin did not say when the corporation would be  established or exactly what form it would take, but said the  government would study whether it should be directly involved  in exploration or development.
