Cuba has told international sugar  operators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March that  these contracts will take second place to Cuba's direct  shipments to its export markets, dealers here said.
Traders said signs of Cuba's shortage of immediately  available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was  probably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender  last month.
Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive  March shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to export  markets, traders said.
