Kuwait may re-register part of its  tanker fleet with foreign flag jurisdictions, including the  U.S. And USSR, in an attempt to protect them from Iranian  missile attacks in the Gulf war zone, U.S. Officials were  quoted by the New York Times as saying.
Kuwait had earlier  declined an offer of U.S. Naval escorts as too public an  admission of its need for protection, they said.
Soviet flag tankers transporting Kuwaiti oil through the  Gulf may get Soviet escorts, the officials said.
The U.S. And Kuwait have been negotiating for over a month  on methods of protecting Kuwaiti ships.
