The state government recently introduced a new workers'  compensation act which would cut the cash benefits to injured  workers by up to a third.
NSW state premier Barrie Unsworth has said workers'  compensation has risen steeply in recent years and the proposed  cuts would save hundreds of mlns of dollars a year.
Union officials said industrial action could spread to  other states as the federal government also plans to make sharp  cuts in workers' compensation.
