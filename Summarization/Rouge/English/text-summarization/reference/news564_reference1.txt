The Reagan administration wants to  encourage expanded trade with the Soviet Union but does not  believe Moscow yet warrants most-favored-nation treatment,  Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said.
To that end, the administration in January allowed foreign  policy controls on the export of oil and gas equipment to the  Soviet Union to lapse, he said.
Whitehead said, however, the prefential treatment that  comes with most-favored-nation status is out for the moment.
U.S. law prohibits most-favored-nation status for countries  that restrict emigration and other rights.
