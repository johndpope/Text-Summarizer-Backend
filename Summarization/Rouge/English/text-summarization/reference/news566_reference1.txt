China should tighten imports of ordinary  goods and restrict or even forbid import of goods which can be  made domestically, Premier Zhao Ziyang said.
"We should expand production of import substitutes and  increase their proportion," he said.
On exports, China should increase its proportion of  manufactured goods, especially textiles, light industrial  goods, electronics and machinery, he said.
Zhao said China should lower the cost of exports and  control the export of goods that incur too much loss.
