President Reagan called for continued  nondiscriminatory treatment for Romanian exports to the United  States in the face of congressional opposition because of the  Bucharest government's record on human rights.
A White House statement said Reagan's decision to press for  continuation of so-called Most Favored Nation (MFN) status for  Romania had been "exceptionally difficult" and came after "all  options were seriously considered."      But the statement said that despite concerns about human  rights abuses by the Bucharest government, the president had  decided that should be continued because it helped stimulate  emigration from Romania and gave the United States influence on  human rights practices there.
