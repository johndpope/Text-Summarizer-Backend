General Cinema Corp said it expects  flat net income for fiscal 1987 ending Oct. 31 against 125.8  mln dlrs or 3.43 dlrs a share a year ago.
The company said the costs of a restructuring at its Carter  Hawley Hale Stores Inc unit and the previous purchase of an 8.5  pct stake in &lt;Cadbury Schweppes PLC> will lead to the flat net  figure.
It also said it may raise its stake in Cadbury Schweppes to  25 pct, but has not made any additional stock purchases so far.
