Union and New South Wales government  officials have reached a compromise in a dispute over workers  compensation, averting increased industrial action in the  state, union sources said.
State officials said the government had agreed to revise  its proposals to cut compensation and would allow slightly  higher cash benefits for injured workers.
Under the original proposal, which sparked strikes and  other industrial action in the state on April 7, workers'  compensation would have been cut by one third.
