U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker met West  German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank  President Karl Otto Poehl in Frankfurt on Monday, a Bonn  Finance Ministry spokesman said.
The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for  increasing short-term money market interest rates.
He had said  the rise was not in line with the spirit of the Louvre accord  aimed at stabilizing the U.S. dollar last February.
Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl had agreed to pursue the  policies agreed under the Louvre pact with reference to  currency stability and monetary policy.
