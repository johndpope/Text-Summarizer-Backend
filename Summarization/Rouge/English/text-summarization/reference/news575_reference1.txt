Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he  regards a U.S. Dollar below 150 yen as counter to the agreement  struck by major nations in Paris last month.
He told the Upper House Budget Committee in Parliament that  Japan intervened in the market when the dollar went below 150  yen, as it considered the dollar's fall below that level  counter to the spirit of the Paris accord.
Behind the recent dollar fall lies the market perception  that major nations were not doing enough to implement their  policies under the Paris pact, he said, noting that passage of  Japan's 1987/88 budget has been delayed.
He said that now was the time for major nations to act  under the Paris accord.
