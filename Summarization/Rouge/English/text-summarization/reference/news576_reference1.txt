Federal Reserve Board  Chairman Paul Volcker said the U.S. Trade deficit is a  challenge for the U.S. Equal to the Soviet Union launching of  Sputnik.
"The international challenge implicit in our huge trade  deficit has become the 1980s equivalent to the launch of  Sputnik by the Russians in the 1950s, when we suddenly feared  we were to be left in the wake of Soviet technological  achievement," he said in an address to Florida educators.
He said the trade problem underscored the need to reform  the U.S. Educational system to improve economic performance.
