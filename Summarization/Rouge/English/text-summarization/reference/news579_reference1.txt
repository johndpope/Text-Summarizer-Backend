A group led by Far Hills, N.J.,  investors Natalie and Paul Koether told the Securities and  Exchange Commission it has acquired 299,523 shares of American  Physicians Service Group Inc, or 5.1 pct of the total.
As they have done in several SEC filings concerning other  companies in which they have had a stake, the Koethers said  they reserve the right "to take any actions which they deem  appropriate to maximize the value of the shares," but said they  have no current plans about taking any action.
While they may buy more American Physicians shares, the  Koethers also said they may decide to sell some or all of the  their stake in the company.
