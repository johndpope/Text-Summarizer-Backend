Japan denied breaking a pact with the  U.S. On semiconductor trade but said prices set out in the pact  were too high and acknowledged difficulties in implementing the  accord.
He said the high semiconductor prices recommended by the  agreement were leaving Japanese manufacturers piling up stocks  of unsellable products.
"We are aiming to reduce production in  Japan but of course this takes time," he said.
