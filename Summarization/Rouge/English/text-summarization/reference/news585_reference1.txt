Strong south-easterly winds were  keeping many vessels trapped in the ice off the Finnish and  Swedish coasts in one of the worst icy periods in the Baltic  for many years, the Finnish Board of Navigation said.
Weather officials in neighbouring Sweden said the icy  conditions in the Baltic were the worst for 30 years, with  ships fighting a losing battle to keep moving.
Weather forecasts say winds may ease during the weekend but  a further drop in temperature could bring shipping to a  standstill, the officials said.
