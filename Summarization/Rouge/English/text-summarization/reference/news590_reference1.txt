India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas  Commission (ONGC) plans to drill more wells in the Bombay  offshore area, where a well spudded in February this year gave  both oil and gas, an ONGC spokesman said.
We've decided to drill at least three more wells in  there before starting production on a commercial scale."      Production of Bombay High, part of the Bombay offshore  field, has stabilised at around 500,000 barrels per day for the  last two years.
Bombay High accounted  for 20.61 mln tonnes, marginally up from 20.10 the year before.
ONGC has been exploring the Bombay offshore area, developed  since the late 1970s, for more oil as production from Bombay  High has reached a plateau.
