more      The Quebec government has said it wants the project to  proceed because it would provide future demand for Petromont  Inc petrochemical products.
Its Montreal plant would provide  ethylene as a raw material for the project.
Quebec said it also wants Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd  &lt;IPIPF.O> to adapt its pipeline from Sarnia, Ont., to Montreal  to carry natural gas liquids, a decision that will be made by  the federal National Energy Board.
It said the pipeline could  provide Petromont with feedstock at one-third the cost of  moving it by rail.
