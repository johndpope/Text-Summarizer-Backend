U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz  warned members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN) they could no longer rely on increased exports to the  U.S. For growth.
Would cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than many  now believed.
He said ASEAN's looming trade problems would not  necessarily stem from protectionist legislation now being  contemplated by Congress, "but simply because of the adjustments  the U.S. Economy will have to make in order to service our  large and growing external debt."      Shultz said the U.S. Deficit had resulted not from falling  exports but from higher imports that had fuelled world growth.
