South Yemen is planning a major oil  pipeline system to be completed in 18-months time to start  exports at a initial rate of 100,000 barrels per day, (bpd) the  Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said.
MEES said the Soviet firm Technoexport, which is  developing oilfileds for South Yemen, has substantially  increased its initial reserve estimates and recommended a  pipeline with an eventual 500,000 bpd capacity.
