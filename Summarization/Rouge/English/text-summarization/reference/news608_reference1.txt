The Bank of France said it set a money  market intervention tender today to inject funds to the market  against first category paper.
Money market sources said the surprise announcement might  herald a quarter percentage point cut in the central bank  intervention rate from the 7-3/4 pct level set March 10, but  they added such a cut was relatively unlikely.
Technical factors making for a slight shortage of liquidity  in the market included the settlement yesterday of the latest  monthly treasury tap stock tender, on March 5, market sources  said.
