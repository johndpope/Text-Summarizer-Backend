Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Hisham Nazer  said Riyadh would not agree to a cut in oil prices and would  not accept a "mad" increase that would drive consumers away.
It does not approve of a decrease in  prices from current levels and it also does not accept a mad  increase that would drive consumers away and make them try and  find alternative sources (for energy)."      OPEC agreed last December to cut production after world  prices hit new lows in 1986.
They agreed on a pricing system  aimed to stabilize the market around 18 dlrs a barrel.
The  current pact set a production ceiling for first half 1987 of  15.8 mln bpd, and implemented fixed prices based on an 18 dlrs  a barrel average.
