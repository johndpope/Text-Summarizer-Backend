Apex Oil, primarily a trading company, charged that several  companies, including Belcher, and NYMEX conspired to force it  to deliver heating oil it had sold on the mercantile exchange,  knowing Apex could not make full delivery.
The NYMEX ordered Apex to deliver four mln barrels of  heating oil sold via a February 1982 heating oil contract.
Richard Wiener, attorney for Apex at Cadwalader Wickersham  and Taft, said the company has not yet decided whether to  pursue its case against Belcher Oil.
