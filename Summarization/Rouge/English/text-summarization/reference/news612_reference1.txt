World seaborne iron ore imports will  fall sharply by the year 2000 with declining imports to the EC  and Japan only partially offset by increased demand from South  East Asia, a report by Ocean Shipping Consultants said.
The report predicts annual world seaborne iron ore imports  of 267.7 mln tonnes by 2000 versus 312.4 mln tonnes in 1985.
The report sees EC imports falling to 91.7 mln tonnes in  2000 from 123.6 mln in 1985 with Japanese imports falling to 89  mln from 124.6 mln tonnes.
