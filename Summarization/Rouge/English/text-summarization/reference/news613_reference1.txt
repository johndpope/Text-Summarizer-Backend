During 1986 the company opened 81 new stores, including 76  in the U.S., Two in Australia and one each in Japan, Canada and  the U.K.
"We intend to open a minimum of five more units in London  for example and it is reasonable that we might open other  stores in other European countries in 1988," Fields said.
