The 37,635 deadweight tonnes bulk carrier  Cumberlande, which sank in the South Pacific last Friday, was  carrying a cargo which included lead as well as magnesium ore,  a Lloyds Shipping Intelligence spokesman said.
Trade reports circulating the London Metal Exchange said  the vessel, en route to New Orleans from Newcastle, New South  Wales, had been carrying 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates.
Traders said this pushed lead prices higher in early morning  trading as the market is currently sensitive to any fundamental  news due to its finely balanced supply/demand position and low  stocks.
