Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul  Volcker said current data does not give a clear sign that the  deterioration in the U.S. trade balance has yet been reversed.
"The data we have in hand do not provide clearcut evidence  that the deterioration in the trade balance has yet been  reversed," Volcker said in remarks prepared for delivery to a  luncheon for community leaders here.
However, Volcker said there are encouraging signs,  particularly the rising volume of exports over the past year,  achieved despite relatively slow growth abroad.
