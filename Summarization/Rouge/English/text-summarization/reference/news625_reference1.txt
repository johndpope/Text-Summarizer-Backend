Finance Minister Michael Wilson said  large inflows of capital into Canada, principally into the  country's bond market, is a major reason behind the sharp  recovery in the Canadian dollar.
He said the inflow of funds, mainly from Japan, Europe and  the United States, is the result of "confidence in the  direction this country is going in."      "That is the reason why the (Canadian) dollar today is  higher than 75 cts (U.S.) compared to this time last year (when  it was) a little over 69 cts," Wilson told the House of Commons  daily question period.
Figures released this week show foreigners purchased a  record 23.1 billion dlrs of Canadian bonds in 1986, more than  double the previous year, with Japan investing a record 9.5  billion dlrs in the market.
