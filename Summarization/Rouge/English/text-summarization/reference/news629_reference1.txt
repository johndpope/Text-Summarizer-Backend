Acting Turkish Prime Minister Kaya Erdem said earlier today  Greek activities in the northern Aegean contravened the 1976  Berne Agreement which set the framework for talks on the Aegean  continental shelf disputed between Ankara and Athens.
It has been stressed to...Mr Akiman that the decision where or  how to drill belongs exclusively to the Greek government."      "The Greek government has repeatedly let the Turkish side  know that it considers the 1976 Berne protocol as inactive  through the fault of Turkey," it said.
The Greek statement said Athens was ready to put the  continental shelf issue before international courts.
