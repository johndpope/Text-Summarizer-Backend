Japan is expected to post a 3.6 pct rise  in real gross national product in 1987/88, higher than the  official 3.5 pct target, a private economic institute said.
The institute assumed an average exchange rate in the year  starting April 1 of 150 yen to the dollar.
The institute forecast that Japan's exports will gradually  rise in the year in volume terms as the dollar's fall in the  past 18 months is likely to help prop up the U.S. Economy.
