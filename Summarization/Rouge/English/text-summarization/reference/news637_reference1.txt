Comalco Ltd said its return to profit  reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and  its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture.
It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the  year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was  also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and  greater sales of bauxite and aluminium.
Comalco said its extraordinary provision of  27.3 mln dlrs costs for Goldendale losses and closure may be  reduced if the sales agreement were completed.
