Swedish mining and metals group  Boliden AB &lt;BLDS ST> forecast a return to profitability during  1987 after recording a 1.08 billion crown 1986 loss burdened by  a massive write-off.
The company, which consolidated the Swedish wholesale and  investment conglomerate &lt;Ahlsell AB> this year, said the result  included restructuring costs and write-offs of 802 mln crowns.
As a result of the 1986 losses, the board proposed  cancelling dividend for the year although it predicted a return  to profitability during 1987, the statement added.
Trelleborg then said it had no plans  for consolidating Boliden.
