A Belgian finance ministry spokesman  said new rules planned on insider trading would enable  offenders to be fined and imprisoned for up to a year, and be  compelled to forfeit gains.
The new rules require parliamentary approval, and  government sources said it was unclear when they would come  into force.
The cabinet approved a separate bill that analysts said  includes provisions to make more difficult the build-up of  major new stakes in Belgian companies.
