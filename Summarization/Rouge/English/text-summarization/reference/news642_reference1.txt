Analyst Sanford Margoshes of Shearson  Lehman Brothers said he recommended a number of oil stocks  today now that it is apparent that OPEC has succeeded in  holding to its prescribed production quotas.
"It is clear that OPEC, through jawboning and quota  restraint, will boost the price of oil," Margoshes said.
Prices of oil stocks rose sharply today in response to  higher oil prices and optimism about OPEC quotas.
Before the year is out we will see higher  oil prices."      He noted that belief that the government is interested in  raising the strategic reserves is factored into the rise in oil  stocks today.
