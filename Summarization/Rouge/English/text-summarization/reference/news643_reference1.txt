Venezuela's state oil  company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. wants to raise its  worldwide refining capacity by 150,000 barrels of per day, a  company official attending the National Petroleum Refiners  Association meeting here said.
He declined to be identified but said PdVSA has the  capacity to refine about 650,000 bpd of crude oil from refining  centers  in Venezuela, Sweden, West Germany, Belgium, and the United  States.
Refineries abroad, he said, guarantee a refining outlet for  Venezuelan crude oil while ensuring stability of supply to  refiners.
