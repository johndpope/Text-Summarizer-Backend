Mannesmann AG &lt;MMWG.F>, the  diversified engineering and pipe-making group, is interested in  taking a stake in a U.S. Company or companies but has not yet  found a suitable firm, a spokesman said in reply to questions.
He also said the group had not yet completed taking over a  stake in car components firm &lt;Fichtel und Sachs AG>.
Mannesmann had said in January it hoped to take a 37.5 pct  stake in Fichtel und Sachs's holding company, Sachs AG, in the  first quarter.
