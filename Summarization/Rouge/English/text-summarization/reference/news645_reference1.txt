A Mannesmann AG &lt;MMWG.F> spokesman  said the company has lodged an application with the Federal  Cartel Office for approval of a possible majority stake in car  parts company &lt;Fichtel und Sachs AG>.
Until now Mannesmann has said only that it wanted to  buy a 37.5 pct stake in Fichtel from the heirs of Ernst Wilhelm  Sachs, the grandson of the firm's founder.
The spokesman declined to say from whom it may buy the  other shares to create a majority stake in the firm.
Mannesmann said in January it hoped to take a 37.5 pct  stake in Fichtel's holding company Sachs AG in the first  quarter.
