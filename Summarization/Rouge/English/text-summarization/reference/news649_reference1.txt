French farmers are planning to cut their  maize sowings by between 100,000 and 150,000 hectares this year  from the 1.87 mln ha harvested in 1986, the French Maize  Producers' Association, AGPM, said.
It said its first estimate of planting intentions indicated  cuts of 15 to 20 pct in plantings in the northern region of  Picardy and the Paris Basin, which harvested 192,000 ha last  year.
In the  south-west the AGPM said producers intended to plant a similar  area to last year's 671,100 harvested hectares, provided water  supplies are adequate in the Midi-Pyrenees region after the  last two years of drought.
