U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic  Affairs Allen Wallis said he had urged Japan to do much more to  reduce its large trade surplus with the United States.
"What we need is a resolution of trade issues, we need  visible efforts to restructure the economy to encourage more  imports and we need greater domestic-led growth."      Forecasting sluggish economic growth in Japan this year,  Wallis urged Tokyo to stimulate domestic demand to help reduce  its trade surplus, which hit a record 83 billion dlrs in 1986.
Despite the pact, Japanese  producers are still dumping microchips in foreign markets other  than the United States while U.S. Penetration of the Japanese  market has not increased, he said.
