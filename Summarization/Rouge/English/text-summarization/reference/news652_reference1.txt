First Interstate Bancorp said its  1987 pre-tax income could be reduced by about 33.5 mln dlrs if  it decides to reclassify its 339 mln dlrs in medium- to  long-term loans to Brazil as nonperforming.
But First Interstate said that if Brazil's suspension of  interest payments continues, it may have to reclassify its  loans as nonperforming and place them on non-accrual, meaning  that interest previously accrued but not paid would be deducted  from net income and interest would no longer be accrued.
Besides its medium- and long-term debt, First Interstate  said it also has 165 mln dlrs in short-term loans or trade  lines in Brazil.
