Peru will put into effect today a foreign  exchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide  in the country's international reserves, a government decree in  the Official Gazette said.
Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs  compared to 1.54 billion dlrs a year ago.
The  central bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in  accordance with guidelines set by the council.
Peru's reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade  surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in  1985, according to preliminary central bank estimates.
