The Soviet Union supports the freedom  of navigation in the Gulf and does not support any act which  would cause the deterioration of the situation in the region,  its ambassador to Kuwait, Ernest Zverev, told the Kuwaiti news  agency KUNA.
"We support the freedom of navigation in the Arabian Gulf  and the Strait of Hormuz," the agency quoted Zverev as saying.
A British naval source in the Gulf said today Iran had  test-fired its new Silkworm missiles and set up launching sites  in the area.
