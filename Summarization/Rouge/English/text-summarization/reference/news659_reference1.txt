Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein  Mousavi said Iran had "more effective" missiles at its disposal  than the shore-to-sea missiles which had provoked U.S. Concern,  Tehran Radio reported.
Tehran Radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp,  quoted Mousavi as saying that Tehran officially announced after  its forces overran southern Iraq's Faw peninsula in February  last year that it had shore-to-sea missiles.
"The fact that the Americans, after so much delay, are now  thinking of expressing their concern with panic is because  Reagan needs this sensation now," said Mousavi, speaking after a  cabinet meeting in Tehran.
