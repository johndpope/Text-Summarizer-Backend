Italy is to modify restrictions limiting  the amount of lira cash that can be brought in and out of the  country, the Foreign Trade Ministry said.
A statement said Foreign Trade Minister Rino Formica has  signed a measure lifting currency regulations that currently  impose a 400,000 lire limit on the value of lira bank notes  that can be brought into Italy.
The statement said the 400,000 lire limit would remain for  Italian residents wishing to take cash out of the country, but  non-residents could re-export lira cash if they made  appropriate declarations at customs points.
