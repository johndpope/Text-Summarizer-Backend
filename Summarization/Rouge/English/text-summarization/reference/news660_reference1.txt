A new steel quota system that would  strictly limit European Community (EC) support to the industry  could be forced on producers if they fail to find their own  solution quickly, officials said.
The ministers stopped short of imposing their own solution  immediately, instead urging steel producers to try again to  reach agreement on voluntary cutbacks.
The EC Commission has said it will come up with detailed  proposals in July on the future of the EC steel industry and EC  industry ministers meet again in September to reach a final  decision.
