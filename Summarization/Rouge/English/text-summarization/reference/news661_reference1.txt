The U.S. Court of International Trade has  upheld the International Trade Commission's refusal to extend  countervailing duties on Canadian hogs to include pork  products, the National Pork Producers' Council said.
The court's ruling came in an appeal to the Trade  Commission's decision filed by the Pork Producers' Council.
An appeal by the Canadian Pork Council that the current  countervailing duty on Canadian hogs entering the U.S. be  lifted is pending before the Court.
