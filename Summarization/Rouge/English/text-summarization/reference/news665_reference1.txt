Mead Corp said the outlook for its  major paper markets looks strong for the second quarter and  augurs well for its earnings in 1987.
"The generally strong outlook bodes well for significantly  improved earnings this year," Burnell Roberts, chairman and  chief executive officer said.
Earlier, the company reported first quarter earnings of  34.2 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share, versus 20.3 mln dlrs, or  65 cts a share, in last year's first quarter.
Mead said sales of its unbleached coated paperboard was  particularly strong, up 13 pct versus the first quarter 1986.
