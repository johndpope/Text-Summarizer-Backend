Canada's softwood lumber will become  unprofitable for some forest product producers if prices  decline to about 175 U.S. dlrs per thousand board feet of two  by four inch lumber from current levels of about 195 U.S. dlrs,  Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam Zimmerman told  reporters.
Zimmerman reiterated profitability has been hurt by a move  by Canadian negotiators to impose last January a 15 pct export  tax on softwood lumber shipped to the U.S. in exchange for a  U.S. lumbermen's lobby dropping its request for a countervail  duty.
Zimmerman said the adverse impact from lower U.S. lumber  product prices would be felt by lumber mills in eastern Canada  first, migrating westward.
