Heyman intends to reconsider its  proposal to acquire GAF.
Heyman said "In the considerable time that has elapsed  since our original proposal was submitted, the credit and  financial markets have experienced extraordinary and almost  unprecedented deterioration.
As of the present time, the  average interest rate on the financing which we proposed to  raise in connection with the acquisition has increased, since  the original proposal, by approximately 150 basis points."      He said the group intends to promptly review all available  options, including the revision of its offer to reflect current  market conditions.
