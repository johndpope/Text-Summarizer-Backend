&lt;BTR Nylex Ltd> said it will increase  its takeover offer for Borg-Warner Corp's &lt;BOR> listed unit,  &lt;Borg-Warner (Australia) Ltd> (BWA) to five dlrs each from four  dlrs for all issued ordinary and preference shares.
As previously reported, Borg-Warner Corp, which owns 65 pct  of BWA's ordinary shares and 100 pct of the preferences,  advised a month ago that it would not accept the offer.
This meant BTR Nylex's 50.1 pct acceptance condition could  not be met, BWA said in a statement reporting its parent's  decision.
BWA advised shareholders to ignore the offer and said other  parties had expressed interest in bidding for it.
