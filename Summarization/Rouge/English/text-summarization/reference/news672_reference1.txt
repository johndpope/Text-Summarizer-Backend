Turkey is holding a buying tender for  100,000 tonnes of white sugar on March 24, traders here said.
Following lower sugar crops in the past two years analysts  said Turkey needs to import sugar now if it is to continue  filling these export contracts, and may need to buy more.
The semi-official Anatolian Agency recently quoted Turkish  Minister of Industry and Trade Cahit Aral as saying Turkey  would export 100,000 tonnes of sugar this year and import the  same amount.
