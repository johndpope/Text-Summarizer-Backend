&lt;United States Lines Inc> has laid  off 260 employees, almost its entire Far East staff, its Hong  Kong office general manager Elliott Burnside told Reuters.
He declined comment on local press reports that U.S. Lines  planned to suspend operations because of failure to restructure  its 1.27 billion U.S. Dlr debt, but said the firm would make an  announcement later today.
Lines decided yesterday to sell its two remaining transpacific  service fleets and assets and those of its U.S.-South America  operation.
U.S. Lines' Far East operations comprise offices in Hong  Kong, Singapore, Manila, Busan, Seoul, Tokyo, Yokohama, Kobe  and Osaka, Burnside said.
