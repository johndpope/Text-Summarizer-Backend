U.S. personal income rose 0.2 pct, or  7.9 billion dlrs, in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate  of 3,630.0 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said.
The  department previously estimated April income rose 0.3 pct.
The department said both the April and May increases in  personal income were restrained by lower subsidy payments to  farmers and by initial payments to a newly established  retirement fund for federal government employees in April.
Farmers' incomes fell 11 billion dlrs in May after  decreasing 6.7 billion dlrs in April due to lower farm subsidy  payments, the department said.
