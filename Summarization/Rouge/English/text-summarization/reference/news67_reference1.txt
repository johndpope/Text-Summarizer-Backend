The Andean Development Corp (CAF) said  today it is lending 11.7 mln dlrs to Ecuador to help repair 25  miles of oil pipeline destroyed by an earthquake earlier this  month.
Ecuador expects oil production to be suspended for four  months as a result of the damage, and has asked Venezuela to  help by supplying 50,000 barrels per day while the pipeline is  repaired.
