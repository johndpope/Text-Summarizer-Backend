Japan cannot bear a further rise of the  yen, Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said.
"A further stronger yen would be a misfortune for Japan and  the Japanese people would not be able to bear such a burden," he  told reporters.
The minister said he wants to tell U.S. Political leaders  of the sacrifices Japan is making to cut its trade surplus.
If the boycott is lifted tomorrow, Kuranari would probably  have to remain in Japan to attend parliamentary discussions on  the government's 1987/88 budget, Japanese officials said.
