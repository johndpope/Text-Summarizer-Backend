House Ways and Means Committee  Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation  to pass a protectionist trade bill this year.
But he warned that his "conciliatory message" on the trade  bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn  other countries their access to the American market would be  curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods.
However, he said there would likely be changes in the  market access proposal from the plan which cleared the House  last year.
