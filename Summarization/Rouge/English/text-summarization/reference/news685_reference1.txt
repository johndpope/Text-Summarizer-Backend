Upcoming changes being considered in  the U.S. Agriculture Department's transportation and loan  programs were outlined by a USDA official today.
Changes in USDA's reserve rotation program are also under  consideration, VonGarlem said.
While the department has not  made any final decision, banning the use of pik and roll grain  in reserve rotation is under heavy consideration, he said.
He also said wheat will not be considered for a cash bonus  under the Conservation Reserve Program.
