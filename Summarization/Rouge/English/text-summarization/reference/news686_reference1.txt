Britain's highest court has decided the  International Tin Council (ITC) can appeal over the use of ITC  documents in court actions.
The House of Lords ruling on the use of ITC documents will  be referred back to the action by two Shearson Lehman companies  against the London Metal Exchange although the underlying case  is not expected to be resumed until mid-1988.
The Court of Appeal hearings include action between brokers  and cases by brokers and banks against the ITC and the member  governments of the tin council.
