McIntyre Mines Ltd said it completed  the previously announced sale of all shares of wholly owned  Smoky River Coal Ltd and certain related assets to Smoky River  Holdings Ltd for a nominal cash consideration.
McIntyre said it retained an unspecified royalty interest  in Smoky River Coal based on net operating cash flows from the  company's coal properties.
McIntyre also said it provided a three mln dlr last  recourse letter of credit to the Alberta government for Smoky  River Coal's reclamation obligations.
McIntyre said it also remains contingently liable for  certain obligations now totalling about seven mln dlrs, which  will reduce over time as Smoky River continues to operate.
