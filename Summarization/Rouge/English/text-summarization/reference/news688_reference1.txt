A supply shortage of number two oil in  New York for prompt delivery boosted the April heating oil  contract on U.S. energy futures, traders said.
"The rally was led by spot month heating oil contract,  which seemed to move higher because of tigtened prompt  deliveries in New York Harbor," said James Ritterbusch, vice  president at Paine Webber Inc in Chicago.
Ritterbusch said the market also found support from a  report in the Middle East Economics Survey that said that OPEC  oil output was down to about 14 mln barrels per day in the  second week of March.
Redoglia and Ritterbusch said April heating oil could  continue to rally above 53 cts a gallon, while crude futures  could test 19 dlrs a barrel before profit-taking stunts the  move higher.
