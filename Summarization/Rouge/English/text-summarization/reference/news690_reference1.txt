The Treasury Department said it  notified the Netherlands that it was terminating the 1948  income tax treaty as it applies to the Netherlands Antilles and  Aruba.
The decision means the sale by U.S. parent companies of  Eurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will no  longer be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, the  spokesman said.
Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles   may cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early.
He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have an  adverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the general  decline in interest rates means they will be able to refinance  at lower interest rates.
