A Swedish Finance Ministry committee  forecast that British Petroleum Plc &lt;BP.L> may have to close  its refinery in Gothenburg because of an anticipated worsening  of the Swedish petroleum industry's competitiveness.
The committee said the BP refinery, which lacks a  de-sulphurisation plant, was likely to be closed or sold unless  costly investments were made to enhance the facility's capacity  to refine a broader range of products.
There was nobody at British Petroleum immediately available  for comment.
