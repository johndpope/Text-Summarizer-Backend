Taiwanese investment in the U.S. Is  expected to nearly double to 80 mln U.S. Dlrs in calendar 1987  and rise to 400 mln dlrs a year by 1991, a five-year forecast  by the Economic Ministry showed.
Lee Ming-Yi, deputy director of the ministry's Industrial  Development and Investment Centre, said the forecast rise is  due to planned government incentives and growing willingness  among Taiwanese to invest abroad.
Lee told Reuters the incentives, to be introduced in May or  June, include bank loans and a reduction in capitalisation  requirements for businesses seeking to invest in the U.S. To 10  mln Taiwan dlrs from 20 mln.
