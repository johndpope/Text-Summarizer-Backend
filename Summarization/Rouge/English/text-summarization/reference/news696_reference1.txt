Canamax Resources Inc and Pacific  Trans-Ocean Resources Ltd said they conditionally approved  starting production at their jointly owned Ketza River gold  deposit in the Yukon after a study recommended the move.
They said they would mine 460,000 tonnes of proven and  probable mineable reserves of oxide ore grading 0.45 ounce gold  per ton at a yearly rate of 112,000 tonnes for a mine life of  4.25 years.
Possible reserves of 75,000 tonnes grading 0.38 ounce gold  per ton at the break zone would extend mine life by a year,  with considerable potential for development of further oxide  ore reserves at the deposit, they said.
