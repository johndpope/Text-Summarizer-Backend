The European Community Commission said  it has opened an enquiry into allegations that the Soviet Union  is dumping mercury on the European market at below-cost prices.
The Commission said its decision follows a complaint from  EC non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of Soviet  mercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in the  European industry.
The Commission said the industry would probably be unable  to hold prices at current levels and that any increase would  result in loss of sales and jobs.
