Indonesia has issued licences to  traders to import palm oil to avert a possible shortage of  cooking oil during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan in May,  Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh told Reuters.
Indonesia, the world's second largest palm oil producer,  earlier denied it had granted palm oil import licences.
Saleh was replying to a question from Reuters after traders  in London said Indonesia had issued licences to import around  135,000 tonnes of palm oil for delivery in April.
Indonesia is expanding palm oil output, and Saleh did not  explain why there might be a shortage during Ramadan.
