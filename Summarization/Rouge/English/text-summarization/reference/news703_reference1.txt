The Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI) has asked about 30 Japanese trading houses and  exporters to refrain from excessive dollar selling, trading  house officials said.
The officials told Reuters MITI asked them to moderate  their foreign exchange trading because the excessive rise in  the yen will have unfavourable effects on the economy.
A MITI official said the ministry has conducted a survey of  foreign exchange trading by trade houses and exporters.
The trading house officials said MITI had asked them to  undertake foreign exchange transactions with due consideration  to the adverse effects excessive exchange rate movements would  have on the economy.
He said the survey showed currency transactions by trade  houses and exporters contributed little to the dollar fall.
