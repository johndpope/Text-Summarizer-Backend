French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac  told U.S. congressmen France would announce a decision in two  to three weeks on which group is to control its second largest  communications firm, Compagnie Generale de Construction  Telphoniques, French sources said.
U.S. and German companies are the leading contenders to  take control of CGCT.
The Reagan administration has warned France and Germany  that it may retaliate if control of the company is awarded on  political grounds.
Chirac said France would make public its reasons for  awarding control, the sources said.
