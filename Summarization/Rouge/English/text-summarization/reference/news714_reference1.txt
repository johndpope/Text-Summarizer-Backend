Brown-Forman Inc said its board  has approved a three-for-two stock split and a 35 pct increase  in the company cash dividend.
The company said directors declared a quarterly cash  dividend on each new share of both classes of 28 cts, payable  April one to holders of record March 20.
Brown-Forman said nine month profits declined a bit to 66.0  mln dlrs, or 3.07 dlrs a share, from 66.2 mln dlrs, or 3.08  dlrs a share, a year earlier due to a second quarter charge of  37 cts a share for restructuring its beverage operations.
The company said lower corporate tax rates and the  restructuring "are expected to substantially improve  Brown-Forman's earnings and cash flow in fiscal 1988."
