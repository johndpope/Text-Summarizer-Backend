Harper and Row Publishers Inc said its  special committee of independent directors has received  expressions of interest from a considerable number of domestic  and foreign firms with respect to restructuring or acquisition  transactions with the company.
Winthrop Knowlton, chairman of special committee said "no  determination has been made by the full board as to any  transaction."      He said the special committee and Kidder Peabody and Co Inc  intend to engage in discussions with interested parties in an  effort to come to a conclusion in the near future.
Formation of the special committee was announced early last  week when Harper and Row said its board had taken no action on  two pending acquisition proposals.
