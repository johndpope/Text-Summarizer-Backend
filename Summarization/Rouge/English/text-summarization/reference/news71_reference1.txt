Itoh and Co Ltd &lt;CITT.T> have decided to sell  their combined 65 pct stake in Indonesia's &lt;Pt Triguna Utama  Machinery Industries> to &lt;Caterpillar Tractor Co>,  spokesmen  for the two Japanese companies said.
Triguna, set up in 1982, is owned 40 pct by MHI and 25 pct  by C.
The spokesmen said the sale results from an expected  restructuring later this year of the 50/50 Caterpillar/MHI  joint venture Japanese company &lt;Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd>,  formed in 1963.
It will  still be owned equally by MHI and Caterpillar and will be set  up with the aim of centralising MHI's excavator business.
