Showboat Inc will take a  charge of 19 to 20 mln dlrs pretax against results for the  third quarter ended March 31, director and assistant to the  president J.
He said the charge results from pre-operating expenses of  its recently-opened Atlantic City, N.J., Showboat Hotel, Casino  and Bowling Center and will cause a loss for the third quarter  and probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well.
But Houssels said Showboat's earnings for fiscal 1988  should show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to the  contribution of the new Atlantic City facility.
Houssels said Showboat since the opening of the Atlantic  City hotel/casino, Showboat has had to start charging interest  expenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facility  directly against income rather than capitalizing the interest  as it had been able to do previously.
