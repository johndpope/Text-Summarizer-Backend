Senate Banking Committee chairman  William Proxmire called for curbs of hostile corporate  takeovers and new restrictions on risk arbitrageurs.
"At the very least, it is high time that we require all risk  arbitrageurs to register seperately and specifically  with the  Securities and Exchange Commission and that we consider  precluding brokerage firms and their employers from investing  in, or owning any securities issued by, third party risk  arbitrage operations," Proxmire said at the start of a hearing  on corporate takeovers.
"A burning issue must be whether there ought to be a  complete seperation in the future of risk arbitrage and  investment banking," Proxmire said.
