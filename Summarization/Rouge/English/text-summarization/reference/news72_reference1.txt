American Telephone and Telegraph Co does  not plan to reduce its regular quarterly dividend of 30 cts a  share on its common stock, said James E.
Although ATT will maintain its current dividend, Olson said  the company wants to decrease the percentage of earnings paid  in dividends by increasing earnings.
Industry analysts had speculated that ATT might cut its  common dividend, especially after the company posted a fourth  quarter net loss of 1.17 billion dlrs and earned only five cts  a share for the full year.
The loss included a one-time restructuring charge of 1.7  billion dlrs.
