Norway's central bank sold crowns in the  open market in a bid to ease strong upward pressure on the  currency, which threatens to rise above set levels in a basket  of currencies, dealers said.
The central bank declined comment, but dealers noted the  bank had also intervened and sold small amounts of crowns on  Friday.
The bank is committed to defending the crown at certain  levels in a basket of 14 trade-weighted currencies.
The crown's index is currently around 109.60 in the basket  -- close to its upper limit of 109.50 which the central bank is  committed to defending.
