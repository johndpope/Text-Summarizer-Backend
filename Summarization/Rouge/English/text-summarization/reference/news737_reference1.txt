Petroleos de Venezuela S.A will  announce within two weeks the name of a foreign consortium it  has chosen to help exploit the coal deposits at Guasare in  western Zulia state, PDVSA president Juan Chacin Guzman said.
Chacin told reporters the foreign partner will provide  capital as well as technical and marketing expertise to the  Carbozulia project, which the state oil company will manage.
PDVSA vice-president Pablo Reimpell said last week the  first shipment of coal from the Carbozulia project should be  made during the final quarter of 1987, and would measure  between 100-150,000 metric tons.
