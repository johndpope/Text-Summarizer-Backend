A study group said the United States  should increase its strategic petroleum reserve to one mln  barrels as one way to deal with the present and future impact  of low oil prices on the domestic oil industry.
U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750  mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect the  economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise.
It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves  and more exploration and development research would help to  guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports.
