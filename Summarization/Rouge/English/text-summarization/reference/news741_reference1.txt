The state-owned Krung Thai Bank Ltd  will start taking over state-owned Sayam Bank Ltd and complete  the process in a year, Finance Minister Suthee Singhasaneh told  a press conference.
The minister said some of the existing 30 Sayam Bank  branches will be merged with their Krung Thai counterparts,  while others will continue operating but under Krung Thai's  name.
Sayam Bank has existed since August 1984 when the Finance  Ministry took over and re-named the Asia Trust Bank Ltd.
Sayam president Waree Havanonda told reporters last month  her bank posted a loss of more than 400 mln baht in 1986.
