Total food aid needs in 69 of the  least developed countries declined in 1986/87, as requirments  fell in many countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, the  U.S. Agriculture Department said.
In a summary of its World Agriculture Report, the  department said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was a  record high in 1986, with gains in almost every country.
However, may developing countries in tropical climates,  such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central  America, are not well adapted for wheat production, and  improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs, the  department said.
