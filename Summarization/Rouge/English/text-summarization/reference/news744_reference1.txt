Healthcare Services Of America  Inc said it will write off about 16 mln dlrs in non-recurring  expenses in 1986.
It also said it expects income from operations to be about  breakeven for 1986 and the estimated loss for the year to be  about the same as the writeoffs.
The company said it continues to be in default of certain  financial and non-financial covenants set forth in its major  loan documents.
Healthcare also said the board has authorized the sale or  lease of certain assets to reduce the cash required from the  revolving credit line for completion of current construction  projects.
