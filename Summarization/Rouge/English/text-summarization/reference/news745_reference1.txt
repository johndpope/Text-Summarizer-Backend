Any European Community decision to  liberalise farm trade policy would hurt Thailand's tapioca  industry, said Ammar Siamwalla, an agro-economist at the  Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI).
He told a weekend trade seminar here that any EC move to  cut tariff protection for EC grains would make many crops more  competitive than tapioca in the European market.
The EC is the largest buyer of Thai tapioca, absorbing more  than two thirds of the 5.8 mln tonnes of pellets exported by  Thailand last year.
