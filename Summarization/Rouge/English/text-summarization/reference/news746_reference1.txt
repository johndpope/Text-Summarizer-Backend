inflation  plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the  economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring  prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.
Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the  value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread  indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250  pct inflation rate.
For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on  target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one  billion dlrs.
But as exports were diverted and imports  increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus  plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged  under 150 mln.
