He described the dollar's sharp fall against the yen at the  start of the week as a "passing incident" and added, "Everyone is  resolved to support the Paris accord."      Questioned about his plan to help the world's poorest  countries, Chirac said he did not envisage any large-scale debt  write-offs.
"I don't think we can talk of write-offs - even the poorest  countries have not asked for that," he said.
Chirac said he wanted commercial banks to give third world  countries better terms in rescheduling their debts, and for the  International Monetary Fund to soften its conditions.
