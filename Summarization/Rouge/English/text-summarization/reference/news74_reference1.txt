November and December production figures also exceeded last  year's totals with the result that output in the first three  months of the season showed a 23.1 pct increase over 1985/86.
Production in the November 1986 to January 1987 period totalled  1.29 mln tonnes.
Domestic consumption increased 7.3 pct to 192,069 tonnes  for the three month period, but this was not sufficient to  prevent a significant rise in stocks, which climbed to 1.62 mln  tonnes by the end of January, compared with 1.52 mln a year  earlier.
