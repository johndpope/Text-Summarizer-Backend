Indonesia has increased its share in a  434-billion-yen aluminium smelter joint venture with Japan from  25 to 37 pct, Asahan Project Authority director A.R. Suhud  said.
The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raised  its share of (P.T. Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company,  capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yen  in government loans to the company for an equity stake.
The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas Economic  Cooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24  billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen.
Suhud said much of the company's 320 billion yen  debt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciation  of the yen against the U.S. Dollar.
The plant is supposed to break even if  prices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne.
