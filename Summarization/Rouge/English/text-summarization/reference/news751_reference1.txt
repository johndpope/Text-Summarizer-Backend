The advisory body said in its report that the yen would  soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global  basis were delayed.
An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall to  slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed to  restructure their economies.
The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cut  Japan's current account surplus to two pct of gross national  product (GNP) in 1993, the report said.
If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar  would remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan's  current-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993.
