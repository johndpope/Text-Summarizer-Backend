Thyssen AG &lt;THYH.F> expects a fall of  between 15 and 20 pct in consolidated turnover in 1986/87,  chief executive Dieter Spethmann said.
The Thyssen group did over 50 pct of its  business outside West Germany.
Last week Spethmann told the annual meeting Thyssen  expected to post a good profit in 1986/87 despite expected  losses in the mass steel-making operations this year.
Spethmann said engineering turnover would not be lower this  year, but lower steel prices would result in a drop in steel  turnover and sales volume.
