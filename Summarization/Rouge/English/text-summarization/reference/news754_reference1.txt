A meeting of eight Latin American  coffee producers ended with a call for continued talks aimed at  arriving at an agreement to stabilize international prices.
Representatives at the meeting said efforts would continue  to be made to reach a regional consensus on export quotas which  could be presented to the International Coffee Organization.
In opening the meeting, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega  said the lack of an accord on export quotas was behind falling  coffee prices, which he said have caused billions of dollars in  losses to countries in the region.
