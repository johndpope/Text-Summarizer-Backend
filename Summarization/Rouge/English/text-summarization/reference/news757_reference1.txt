Baldrige, referring to the U.S.-Japan trade agreement on  semiconductors, said: "Their government wants to live up to it.
He added: "I do not think there will be a trade war at all."      On Friday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300  mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods from April 17,  because of Tokyo's failure to observe the agreement.
The officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon as  Japan started adhering to the agreement.
Baldrige said the Reagan administration hoped the strong  U.S. Action against Japan would convince Congress to tone down  protectionist trade legislation now being drafted.
