Allegheny International Inc, which has  agreed to a merge with a jointly-formed First Boston Inc  affiliate in a deal worth 500 mn dlrs, said shareholders of its  preferred stock have filed a class action complaint against the  company.
The complaint alleges, among other things, that the company  and its board agreed to pay First Boston an illegal seven mln  dlr topping fee if it received a higher offer for the company  prior to the buyout.
The suit contends that this fee hampers Allegheny's ability  to attract other offers or take other actions that would  benefit holders of preferred stock.
The complaints were filed by Robert Moss and other parties  who are believed to own about 230,000 shares of Allegheny's  preferred stock.
