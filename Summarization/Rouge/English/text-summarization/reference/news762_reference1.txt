Dutch sugar traders deny involvement  in a plan to offer more than 850,000 tonnes of sugar to  intervention in protest at EC export policy and prices, traders  told Reuters.
EC Commission sources said yesterday French traders planned  to sell 775,000 tonnes into intervention stocks, West German  traders 75,000 tonnes and Dutch traders 2,500.
The Dutch spokesman added, "The weekly export tender policy  and prices are squeezing the European sugar industry, and this  is the only way in which they can really register their  protest.
