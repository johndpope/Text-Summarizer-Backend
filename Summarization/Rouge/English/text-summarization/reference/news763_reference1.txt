Drought has resulted in a reduction  in China's estimated wheat crop this year to 87.0 mln tonnes,  2.0 mln below last year's harvest, the U.S. Agriculture  Department's officer in Peking said in a field report.
The report, dated March 25, said imports in the 1987/88  season are projected at 8.0 mln tonnes, 1.0 mln tonnes above  the the current season's estimate.
While there are pockets where irrigation is not possible,  most of the wheat crop has access to some water and therefore  has emerged from dormancy and is doing well, the report said.
