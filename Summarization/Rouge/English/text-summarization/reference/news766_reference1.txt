International monetary officials will   rush to paper over the deep cracks that have appeared in the  Louvre accord on currency stability to prevent a dollar  free-fall and to calm turmoil in world capital markets,  economists and currency traders said.
"I don't think the Louvre is dead because if it breaks up  in an acrimonious way, the potential outcome is a rout of the  dollar, higher interest rates and collapsing stock markets.
In a weekend television interview, U.S. Treasury secretary  James Baker sharply criticised a recent rise in West German  money market rates and said the eight month-old Louvre pact to  foster exchange rate stability needs to be reviewed.
