The U.S. House Ways and Means Trade  Subcommittee unanimously approved a toned-down version of  legislation designed to toughen U.S. trade laws and wedge open  foreign markets to more U.S. goods.
"This product could very well be toughening our trade policy  and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this  frightening word 'protectionism'," Ways and Means chairman Dan  Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said.
But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee  debate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to  mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by  countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
