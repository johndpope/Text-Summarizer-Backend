Long delays at the railway crossing on  the Kenyan border have led Uganda to re-route its coffee  exports through a ferry link with the Kenyan port of Kisumu  across Lake Victoria, Ugandan officials based in Kenya said.
Uganda has a direct rail link with the Kenyan port of  Mombasa through which it conducts 70 pct of its external trade  but there is a chronic shortage of railway wagons, they said.
Customs at Kisumu take less than a day compared with two to  three at the Malaba rail border crossing, a Ugandan Railways  official said.
