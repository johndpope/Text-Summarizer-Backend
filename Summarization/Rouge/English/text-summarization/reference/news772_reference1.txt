New Zealand has imposed sanctions  against Fiji in response to that country's change of status to  a republic, acting prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said.
New Zealand will also not renew an agreement  which supports the price of Fijian sugar when it expires in  March.
The loss of aid and sugar supports will cost Fiji about  10 mln dlrs a year.
"We won't be reacting further until these discussions with  the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister have been held,"  Palmer said.
Palmer said the cabinet was happy with the statement from  Commonwealth leaders in Vancouver that Fiji's membership of the  Commonwealth had lapsed.
