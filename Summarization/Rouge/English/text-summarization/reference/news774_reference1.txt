Dart Group Corp &lt;DARTA>, which wants  to acquire Supermarkets General Corp for 1.62 billion dlrs, is  not likely to give up without a fight if its target seeks  another buyer, arbitrageurs said.
Speculation that Dart's offer of 41.75 dlrs per share could  be just the beginning of a bidding contest helped Supermarkets  shares gain one to 42-1/8  on 2.3 mln shares.
One rumor had Federated Department Stores Inc &lt;FDS> taking  a look at Supermarkets General.
If history repeats itself, the Hafts could raise their bid  to 46 dlrs if they are rebuffed by Supermarkets General, the  arbitrageur said.
