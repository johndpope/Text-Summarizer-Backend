NV KLM Royal Dutch Airlines &lt;KLM.AS>  is "absolutely not" negotiating a takeover of U.S. Regional  carrier Air Atlanta, a KLM spokeswoman said in a comment on an  article in the leading Dutch evening paper NRC Handelsblad.
She said KLM had started talks with Vendex International NV  &lt;VENN.AS> on their jointly owned courier service XP Express  Parcel Systems, but declined to confirm an NRC Handelsblad  report saying it wanted to buy the Vendex stake in XP.
KLM said last week it is negotiating a minority stake in  British courier service &lt;IML Air Services Group Ltd>, a  subsidiary of British and Commonwealth Shipping Plc &lt;BCOM.L>,  to strengthen its position in the fast-growing worldwide  door-to-door delivery market.
The KLM spokeswoman said she expected further announcements  about the talks with Vendex to be made early next week.
