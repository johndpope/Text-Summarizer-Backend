Top officials of leading industrial  nations arrived at the U.S. Treasury main building to begin a  meeting of the Group of Five.
Monetary sources have said a fully blown meeting of  the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local  time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m.
Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister  Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night.
At those talks Baker apparently convinced Goria, who  declined to attend the February meeting of the Group of Seven  in Paris, that Italy would participate fully in any meaningful  decisions.
