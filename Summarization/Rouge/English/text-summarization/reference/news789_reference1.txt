The current crude oil price of between  18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next couple  of years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to  keep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said.
Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher  energy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said.
Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the  beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial  countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead  to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he  said.
