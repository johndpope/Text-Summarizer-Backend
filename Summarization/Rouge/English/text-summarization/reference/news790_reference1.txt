A committee of independent directors of  the Standard Oil Co unsuccessfully sought a delay in a tender  offer for Standard shares by British Petroleum Co plc,  according to offering documents.
BP's offering document for its 70 dlr per share offer  describes discussions with Douglas Danforth, who chairs a  special committee of independent directors responsible for  monitoring relations with BP.
Danforth's concerns that the special committee did not have  sufficient time were expressed to Walters in a telephone  conversation and reiterated in a letter from counsel on Monday  of this week.
