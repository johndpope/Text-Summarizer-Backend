Pharmacia AB &lt;PHAB ST> forecast  earnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs  821.2 mln last year on condition that exchange rates remained  at their present parities.
Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off  writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets.
Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it  having used more funds than generated by group operations,  mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares  in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular  Inc.
