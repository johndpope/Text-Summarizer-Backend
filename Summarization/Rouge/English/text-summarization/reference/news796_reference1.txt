Former Prime Minister Robert  Muldoon, an outspoken advocate of a managed float for the N.Z.
Dollar, said the currency is at least 10 pct overvalued.
Muldoon said in a speech last night the exchange rate  should be around 48 U.S. Cents instead of the current 57 cents.
The Labour Party government removed exchange controls and  floated the dollar two years ago when it was worth 44 cents.
He said the dollar was high because of "grossly excessive"  interest rates for government stock.
