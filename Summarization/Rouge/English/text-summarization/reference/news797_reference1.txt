Taiwan's industrial production index,  fell, largely as the result of the rising Taiwan dollar, by  8.18 pct to 140.06 (base 1981) in February from a revised  152.53 in January, the Economy Ministry said.
It was the second consecutive monthly fall, after dropping  nine pct in January, but it was still 26.49 pct up on February  1986 following a very extended rise last year.
The official said the decline was also caused by falling  exports in February due to the climb of the Taiwan dollar,  which has made Taiwanese products more expensive.
It closed at 34.40 to the  U.S. Dollar today, and is expected to rise to about 32 to the  dollar by the end of this year, foreign bankers and economists  said.
