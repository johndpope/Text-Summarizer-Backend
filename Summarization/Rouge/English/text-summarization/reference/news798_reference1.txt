Societe Generale, one of the three largest state-owned  banking groups, said in a statement that its parent company  profit for 1986 totalled 800 mln francs, up 21.2 pct on 1985's  660 mln profit.
The bank's parent company gross operating profits were up  5.4 pct at 21.34 billion francs against 20.24 billion in 1985.
The increase in the bank's gross operating profits was  mostly due to a rise in french franc deposits and personal  loans as well as the development of its financial activities,  Societe Generale said.
