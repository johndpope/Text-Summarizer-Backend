Arvin said it might earn 57 cts to 60 cts a share in the  quarter.
These results also reflect the seasonally low sales pattern  of automotive replacement parts in that period.
Arvin forecast about 85 cts a share net in the second  quarter compared with 68 cts in last year's period.
Arvin's 1986 revenues were 995.6 mln, net reached 41.2 mln  and earnings per share 2.46 dlrs.
Chairman James Baker said 1987 quarterly comparisons will  not conform to historical patterns for the year because the  acquisitions of Schrader and Maremond occurred in different  quarters.
