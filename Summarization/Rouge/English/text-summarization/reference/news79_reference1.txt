The Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow a  total of 800 billion yen worth of financing bills from its  holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of  1,700 billion yen, money traders said.
Of the total, 300 billion yen will yield 3.8992 pct on  sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in a  23-day repurchase accord maturing on April 24.
Tomorrow's surplus is attributable to excess bank holdings  from sales of yen to buy dollars and to huge cash amounts to be  redeposited at banks after the current financial year-end  today, the traders said.
