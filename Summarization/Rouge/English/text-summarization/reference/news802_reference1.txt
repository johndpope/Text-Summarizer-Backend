Payless Cashways Inc chairman David  Stanley told analysts the company's first quarter results to be  reported March 17 will be better than the seven cts per share  reported in the year ago quarter.
"It was not a wonderful sales quarter, but it only  represents 14 pct of the year's total results," Stanley said.
Stanley also said that 1987 full year sales will be in  excess of 1.8 billion dlrs as compared to the 1.5 billion dlrs  reported in 1986.
He also said that analysts' estimates of 1.55  dlr per shr for 1987 "are not crazy."      Payless reported net income of 1.22 dlr per share in 1986.
