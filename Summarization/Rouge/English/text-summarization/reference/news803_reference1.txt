Continuous rebel raids against oil  pipelines and foreign exploration camps endanger Colombia's  present oil bonanza, Franciso Chona, manager of the state-run  oil company Ecopetrol said.
He was speaking after a meeting with Defense Minister  Rafael Samudio, military chiefs and Mines and Energy Minister  Guillermo Perry to review the security situation in the light  of a recent upsurge of leftist guerrilla attacks in the  oil-rich Arauca region, bordering Venezuela.
Ecopetrol chief of security, Retired General Carlos  Narvaez, said security measures would be stricter and that the  armed forces were closely collaborating but gave no details.
