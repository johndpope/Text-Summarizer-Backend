The prospect that other banks will  follow industry leaders Citibank and Chase Manhattan in raising  their prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the credit  markets today, economists said.
Bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two days  of heavy selling when Citibank surprised the market by  announcing a quarter-point increase in its prime rate to 7-3/4  pct.
Chase Manhattan quickly followed.
Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears  of a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, but  economists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whose  policy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets this  week, is already tightening its grip on credit.
