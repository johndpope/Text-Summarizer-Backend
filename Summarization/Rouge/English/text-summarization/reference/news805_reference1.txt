Taiwan said its foreign reserves suffered  about 3.4 billion U.S. Dlrs in exchange rate losses from July  1986 to February 1987 as a result of the rise of the Taiwan  dollar against the U.S. Currency.
Yu Chien-ming, head of the government statistics  department, told parliament yesterday he expected the losses to  increase as the Taiwan dollar continues to strengthen.
Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves now total 53 billion  dlrs.
At end-February they were 52.1 billion dlrs, the world's  third largest after West Germany and Japan.
Yu said the interest earned from the reserves totalled  about 1.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from July 1986 to February 1987.
