The EC Executive Commission said today the European  Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that  Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable  programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.
Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM  market, up from 60 pct in 1984.
The Commission said it believed the Association had given  sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an  investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found  the complaints were justified.
