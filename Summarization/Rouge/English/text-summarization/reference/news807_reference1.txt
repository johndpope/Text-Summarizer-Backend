Britain's Defence Minister George Younger  said the U.S. Was unfairly protecting its defence industry, and  this could lead to British firms demanding counter-measures.
A British parliamentary report said that up to March  British firms had been awarded just 34 mln dlrs worth of  contracts for the Strategic Defence Initiative, compared with  the 1.5 billion dlrs Britain had hoped to secure.
Younger said London had given U.S. Companies contracts  under conditions of fair and open competition.
If new American legislation aimed at curbing unfair  subsidies was used to exclude foreign suppliers it would not be  surprising if British firms pressed for retaliatory measures,  Younger said.
