Ecuador will ask OPEC to raise its oil  export quota by 100,000 barrels per day to 310,000 to  compensate for lost output due to last week's earthquake,  deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite said.
Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss  an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of  Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached.
The additional output would be related to plans now under  discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while  it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake.
Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo  Hernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified  part of Ecuador's export commitments.
