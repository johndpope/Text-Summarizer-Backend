Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said  West Germany would be badly advised to lower interest rates and  that he believed the economy would continue to recover after a  six-month lull.
Asked by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag if lower interest  rates could boost the domestic economy, Poehl said: "We would be  badly advised if we forced further interest rate cuts.
Poehl said Germany had practically no growth in the past  six months because of the mark's surge and the cold winter.
"I expect this  development to continue in the coming months."      Asked about his expectations of a U.S.-European Community  trade war, Poehl said such an event would be disastrous.
