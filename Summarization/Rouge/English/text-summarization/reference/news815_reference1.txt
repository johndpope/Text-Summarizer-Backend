&lt;Billiton  International Metals B.V.>, the Dutch mining company, has urged  Surinam to change policies it says are causing heavy losses on  bauxite mining operations there, a company spokesman said.
He told Reuters that Billiton, a fully-owned Royal  Dutch/Shell &lt;RD.AS> subsidiary, presented the demands to Henk  Heidweiler, a top aide to Surinam military leader Desi  Bouterse, who visited the Netherlands last week for official  talks.
Billiton also urged Heidweiler to improve the safety  of its employees in the campaign against a jungle guerilla  group, the spokesman said, adding rebel fighting since July  1986 had depressed production at Billiton and Suralco plants.
