Woodside Petroleum Ltd &lt;WPLA.S> said  its 1986 net loss largely reflected the drop in oil prices  combined with a large tax provision.
This largely  related to its &lt;Vamgas Ltd> unit, non-allowable exchange losses  and tax benefits from the North-West Shelf project not  recognised in the accounts.
Woodside said the rise in revenue largely reflected full  year sales of gas and condensate from the domestic phase of the  Shelf project, against six month sales in 1985.
It said it lifted capital spending on fixed assets to 269.6  mln dlrs from 178.3 mln, mostly on the Shelf project.
