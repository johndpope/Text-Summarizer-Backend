The Reagan administration continues  to debate whether to offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet  Union, but would need assurances from the Soviets that they  would buy the wheat before the subsidy offer would be made, a  senior U.S. Agriculture Department official said.
Kay called reports that such an offer was imminent "premature."      The Reagan administration's cabinet-level Economic Policy  Council is set to meet today to discuss, among other matters,  agricultural policy but is not expected to address a wheat  subsidy offer to the Soviet Union, administration officials  said earlier.
