Roughly half of this year's expected  130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,  a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the  Netherlands, told Reuters.
Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600  hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of  white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined "A"  and "B" quota of 872,000 tonnes.
This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been  introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000  hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000  tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota "C" sugar produced.
