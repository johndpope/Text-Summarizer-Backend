Grain handling at Rotterdam port's  main grain terminal was at a standstill today as members of the  largest Dutch transport union FNV staged a lightning strike for  the third day running.
Pieter van der Vorm, managing director of Graan Elevator  Mij (GEM), which handles 95 pct of grain passing through the  port, said their main Europoort terminal was out of action  because of a strike by technical staff.
Van der Vorm said that if strikes continued on today's  scale for some time vessels coming to unload grain in Rotterdam  would face delays, but this was not happening yet.
