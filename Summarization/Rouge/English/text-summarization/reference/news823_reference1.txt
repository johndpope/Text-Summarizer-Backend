The U.K. High Court dismissed an appeal  by Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc's &lt;RTZL.L> RTZ Oil and Gas Ltd unit  and ruled that the financial provisions a company makes for the  future cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible,  the Press Association reported.
The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an  annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of  abandoning a rig.
The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the  expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the  expense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were  built into the accounts, one analyst added.
