Ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maize  imports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather,  the official Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported today.
The lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, follows  government concern over "lower than average rainfall in southern  Ghana and its implications for the major harvest."      Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growing  areas throughout the south this year.
GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequences  of current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the drought  experiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps to  alleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.
