Varity Corp, earlier reporting a full  year loss against a prior year profit, said improvement is  expected in the balance of fiscal 1987 as new products fill the  inventory pipeline, cutbacks in operating costs are realized  and its newly acquired Dayton Walther business is fully  integrated.
Varity said continued deterioration in major markets, a  weakening U.S. dollar and unforeseen delays in launching major  new lines of tractors contributed to the full year loss.
However, Varity increased its share of the global tractor  market by more than one pct to 18.2 pct, it said.
