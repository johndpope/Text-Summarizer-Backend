Australian Minister for Trade  Negotiations Michael Duffy said his country and Third World  commodity producers have formed an effective lobby group  against farm export subsidies and market access restrictions.
"There's no doubt that the Cairns Group is being  seen as a third force to be reckoned with both inside the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in other  international trade negotiations," he said.
Duffy, here on a three-day visit after talks in the United  States, The European Community (EC) and Latin America, said  considerable progress has been made by the group towards  fighting costly protectionist policies pursued by developed  countries.
