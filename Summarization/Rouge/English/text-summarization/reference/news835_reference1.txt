Indonesia cannot spend its way out of  recession and has very limited economic options due to lower  world oil prices, Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar was  quoted as saying by the official Antara news agency.
Antara quoted him as saying Indonesia is relying on its  export drive to help narrow its trade deficit.
Antara reported that Siregar said the government wanted to  help boost exports from the rubber and palm oil industries,  which are centered in Sumatra.
