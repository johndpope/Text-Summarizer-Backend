The (central) Bank of Zambia said the kwacha was pegged at  16.99 to the dollar, compared to last week"s rate of 15 to the  dollar.
Last month the government set a fixed exchange rate of nine  kwacha per dollar, subject to adjustment against a basket of  five currencies, for certain official transactions.
The new auction system is designed to be more restrictive  than the previous one, suspended in January after the central  bank fell 10 weeks in arrears to successful bidders.
Under the new system, no bidder, except the the state oil  company Zimoil and the national airline Zambia Airways, is  allowed to bid for more than five pct of the foreign exchange  on offer.
