New York-based Bastian Technologies  Corp said it acquired a five pct stake in Cosmo Communications  Corp, and is considering a move to seek control of the company  or to secure a role in its affairs.
"Bastian Technologies believes that with the appropriate  management policies and business strategies, the company can  once again become profitable and maximize for all shareholders  the underlying value of their company," Bastian said in a  filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Bastian said alternatives being considered include an  attempt to acquire Cosmo through a merger, tender or exchange  offer, seeking to influence the company's management and  policies, and seeking representation on Cosmo's board of  directors through a proxy contest or otherwise.
