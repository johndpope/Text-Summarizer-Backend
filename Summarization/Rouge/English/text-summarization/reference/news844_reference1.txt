The industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago, but  rainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains are  needed in some areas, notably in the Burdekin and Mackay  regions, he said from Brisbane.
He said frequent but light falls in the areas that are  short of moisture, such as Mackay, mean they really only need  about three days of the region's heavy tropical rains to  restore normal moisture to the cane.
But rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucial  to the size of the crop in the dry areas, he said.
