The United States warned Iran again   that it was ready to retaliate for any further hostile military  action in the Gulf as U.S. warships began escorting another  tanker convoy southward from Kuwait.
warships had begun escorting two U.S. flag Kuwaiti tankers --  the 80,000 ton product carrier Ocean City and 46,000 ton  liquified petroleum tanker Gas King -- southward from Kuwait.
The Defense Department said the 12th such convoy of U.S.
flagged Kuwaiti tankers through the Gulf began at 0230 EDT  under the escort by the U.S. guided missile frigate Ford.
"It (the convoy) is now progressing uneventfully in the  central Gulf," the Pentagon statement said.
