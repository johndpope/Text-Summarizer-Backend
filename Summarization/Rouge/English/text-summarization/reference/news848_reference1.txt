They also said the heating oil contract found additional  support from a short-covering rally on the close.
April  heating oil was 1.47 cts higher to 47.91 cts a gallon.
News today, including OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman  statement that OPEC February production did not exceed its  official quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day, helped bouy prices,  traders said.
In addition to short-covering, heating oil found support  from traders buying it against sales of gasoline and crude, as  well as from expectations for continued drawdowns in stocks as  refiners shut down for maintenance, traders said.
