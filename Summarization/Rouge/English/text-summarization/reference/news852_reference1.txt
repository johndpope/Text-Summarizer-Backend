U.S. Exports of edible  groundnuts could fall to 185,000 tonnes in the year to  September 1987 from 248,000 in the same 1986 period, trading  company Tracomin SA said.
Tracomin estimated export availability from the 1986 crop  at 215,000 tonnes compared with 264,000 the previous year.
Tracomin said it expects a good 1987 U.S. Groundnut crop  and forecast a resurgence in U.S. Exports next year.
"Barring any market manipulations, a good U.S. Harvest in  1987 could lead to attractive prices, active trading and the  reappearance of the U.S.A as the world's leading producer of  peanuts," it said.
