While expressing regret over America's decision to impose  tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said  Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington  to help settle the dispute.
Government officials said Japan would make a formal request  next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would  probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17  deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect.
On Friday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300  mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic  goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to  live up to their bilateral chip pact.
