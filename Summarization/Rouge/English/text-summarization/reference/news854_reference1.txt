He said the FCL offer was better  than Amcor's because it would have been made to all NZFP  shareholders, but he gave no further details.
Amcor and NZFP said earlier today they were merging their  pulp and paper interests in a joint partnership and were  increasing their existing cross-shareholdings.
The plan involves NZFP increasing its current holding in  Amcor to about 20 pct from four pct.
Amcor will acquire Rada's  NZFP stake to add to its existing 11 pct and will seek  statutory approval to increase its holding to 50 pct.
