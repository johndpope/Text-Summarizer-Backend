The U.K. government hopes for a  breakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policies  during next week's visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs Minister  Michael Howard, political sources said.
Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from Japanese  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help in  solving the row over a U.K. firm's bid to win a significant  role in Japan's telecommunications market, government sources  said.
Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from  Nakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as a  signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory  outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc,  government officials said.
