The restatement was made because of change in the method of  accounting for a combination of several company-controlled  concerns that resulted in a 53.5 mln dlr charge, Cooper  Development said.
This treatment requires that the costs associated with the  transaction be expanded rather than capitalized as an  intangible asset, the company said.
It also said that, since the charged required an expensing  of previously accrued liabilities, the company will experience  no resulting material change it its cash flow.
