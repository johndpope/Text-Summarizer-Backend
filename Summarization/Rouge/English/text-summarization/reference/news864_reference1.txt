Uganda plans to export roasted coffee to  Europe by the end of 1988, a prominent local businessman said.
A.R. Sendi said on Sunday that Uganda's Ministry of  Industry supports his plan to build a factory to roast, grind  and pack local coffee for export.
He said the Marketing Ministry has authorised the Coffee  Marketing Board to supply his company &lt;Unipack> with 24,000  tonnes of beans a year for processing and export.
Uganda is the world's fifth largest coffee producer, and  expects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year.
