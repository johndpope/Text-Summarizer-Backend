The former chief currency  dealer of Herstatt Bank, which collapsed in 1974 on foreign  exchange speculation in West Germany's biggest banking crash,  can stand trial for damages, a court ruled.
Herstatt creditors are seeking 12.5 mln marks from Dattel,  whom they accuse of causing losses at the bank of over 500 mln  marks by manipulating forward foreign exchange contracts.
The crash of the private Herstatt bank with losses of over  one billion marks stunned West Germany's business community,  and led to a tightening of banking regulations.
But Dattel was freed from prosecution after he produced  medical evidence of paranoia caused by Nazi persecution during  his childhood, which might have led him to take his own life.
