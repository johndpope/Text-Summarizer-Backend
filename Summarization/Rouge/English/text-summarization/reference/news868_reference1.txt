Pan Am Corp said its largest division,  the Atlantic, will report a first quarter loss that will be  substantially lower than that reported a year ago.
Pan Am also said it is encouraged by passenger traffic  results so far this year as well as booking trends.
It also said that based on current trends, its largest  division should report vastly improved second-quarter traffic  compared to last year, which resulted in a load factor of 45.7  pct for the second quarter of 1986.
It said  the airline's operating loss for the year was 325.5 mln dlrs  compared with a operating profit of 196.5 mln dlrs in 1985.
