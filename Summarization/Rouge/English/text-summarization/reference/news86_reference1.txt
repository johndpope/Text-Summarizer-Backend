Pakistan announced a new tea import  policy, saying 70 pct of imports will in future be made through  the state Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP).
Traders said the move was designed to put pressure on Kenya,  which provided some 48 pct of Pakistan's 75-80 mln kilo annual  tea imports, to buy Pakistani manufactured goods in exchange.
Liptons and Brooke Bond, two units of Britain's Unilever  Plc, control 95 pct of Pakistan's hard-pack tea market, traders  said.
