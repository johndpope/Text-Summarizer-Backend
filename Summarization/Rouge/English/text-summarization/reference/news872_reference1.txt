A limited Belgian issue of silver Ecu  coins with a face value of five Ecus will go on sale from March  23 at a price of 500 Belgian francs each, a Finance Ministry  spokesman said.
Gold Ecu coins with a face value of 50 Ecus will be sold  from the same day.
At least two mln silver coins and several hundreds of  thousands of the gold coins will be minted, he said.
Finance Minister Mark  Eyskens, who currently presides over the EC's council of  economic and finance ministers, has called the issue a  political act of symbolic value which aimed to make the  Community's goal of monetary integration more concrete.
