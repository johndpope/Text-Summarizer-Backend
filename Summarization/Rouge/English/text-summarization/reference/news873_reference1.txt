Philippines Trade and  Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers  he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the  European Community (EC) proposed a levy on vegetable oils.
Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC  Council of Ministers, he noted that "I cannot help but wonder  whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of  any real value."      He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion  U.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices, but this had  affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and  services.
