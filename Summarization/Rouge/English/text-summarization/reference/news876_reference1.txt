External risks for the economy have  increased, but growth of two to 2.5 pct this year is still  possible, according to President of the West German Federation  of Banks, Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth.
Schroeder-Hohenwarth told a news conference the further  fall of the dollar since the start of this year and the  revaluation of the mark against European currencies meant West  German exporters were facing a "rough wind."      However, domestic demand was continuing to rise and private  consumption in particular would support the economy, he said.
However, Schroeder-Hohenwarth said the decision to cut  the maximum rate of income tax to only 53 pct from 56 pct was  "rather half-hearted."
