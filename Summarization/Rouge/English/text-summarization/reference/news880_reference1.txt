Minister of Mines Patrick Chitambala  confirmed that Zambia had ended copper shipments through South  Africa and announced that its state-run mining company had  closed down its liaison office in the white-ruled republic.
Diplomatic  sources in Lusaka had earlier expressed doubts over Zambia's  ability to ship all its copper through Beira and Dar es Salaam  without causing massive bottlenecks at the ports.
Chitambala also said that the state-run Zambia Consolidated  Copper Mines (ZCCM) had closed its liaison office in  Johannesburg, since it was now redundant.
