NCR Corp, earlier reporting higher  first quarter profit, said it continues to expect that it will  report record earnings and revenue for all of 1987.
"Our optimism is based on our incoming order rates and the  strength of our product lines," the company said.
NCR earlier said first quarter profit increased to 61.5 mln  dlrs or 65 cts share from 50.2 mln dlrs or 51 cts share in the  prior year.
NCR said the increase in first quarter profit resulted from  strong revenue growth, which was particularly strong in Europe  and Pacific marketing groups.
Order growth was broad based across NCR's product  lines, with the greatest growth coming from U.S., it said.
