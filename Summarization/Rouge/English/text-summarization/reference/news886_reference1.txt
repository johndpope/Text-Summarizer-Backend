The U.S. Agriculture Department said  it will begin charging interest tomorrow on the over 12 mln  dlrs the Department of Transportation, DOT, owes USDA to pay  for its share of the cost of shipping food aid on U.S. vessels.
USDA General Sales Manager Melvin Sims told the Senate  Appropriations Agriculture Subcommittee his department had  billed DOT 12 mln dlrs, and that interest on that amount and an  additional charge would begin accruing April 1.
The two departments are trying to hammer out an accord on  how to fund the increasing share of food aid required to be  shipped on U.S. flag vessels under a 1985 farm bill provision  on cargo preference.
