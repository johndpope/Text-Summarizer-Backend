Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger  will join Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige in fighting  Fujitsu Ltd's &lt;ITSU.T> plan to buy 80 pct of &lt;Fairchild  Semiconductor Corp>, Pentagon officials said.
Commerce Department officials told Reuters yesterday that  Baldrige opposed the planned sale and that the White House  Economic Policy Council will take up the matter within weeks.
Commerce and defense officials said Baldrige and Weinberger  feared the U.S. military is already leaning too heavily on  foreign electronic support.
