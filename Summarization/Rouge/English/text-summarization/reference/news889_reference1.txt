Norway's parliament has approved an  extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a  key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on  Norwegian tankers may continue, government officials said.
As  oil cargoes are often resold after loading, critics said the  door will be left open for continued shipments to South Africa.
Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct  of its crude oil imports during the early 1980s, but the trade  has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months,  trade ministry officials said.
