Canada has threatened to stop imports  of Danish pigmeat from July 14 after Canadian veterinary  inspectors approved only two of 33 slaughterhouses, a Danish  agriculture ministry official told Reuters.
Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion  that the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC  veterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.
But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen said  the inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on EC  regulations.
