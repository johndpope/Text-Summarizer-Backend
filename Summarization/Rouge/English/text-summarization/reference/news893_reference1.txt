Delegates from the National Pork  Producers Council, NPPC, attending the American Pork Congress  in Indianapolis, voted overwhelmingly to recommend the U.S.
Don Gingerich, a delegate from Iowa, said "to have  unpredictable changes come along periodically makes it very  difficult to plan and causes a lot of disruption."      Other members said the farm bill has some imperfections but  that's a price pork producers are willing to pay for  legislative stability, an NPPC spokesman said.
Farm Credit Task Force chairman and newly elected Vice  President of the NPPC Ray Hankes, said delegates wanted a  program that all commodity groups can work with and bring a   resolution to this problem with legislators in Washington.
