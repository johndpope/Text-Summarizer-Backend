The company said it omitted the common dividend to cover  both losses from a commercial ship conversion contract and  increased reserves for previously announced discontinued  shipyard operations.
In addition, the company said its lenders agreed to  temporarily reduce the net worth requirement of its revolving  credit and term-loan pact to 140 mln dlrs from 130 mln.
Todd said the reduction in the net worth requirement  allowed for the payment of the preferred dividend and prevented  it from violating covenants of its credit agreement.
The company said it is also negotiating with its lenders to  extend the reduced net worth terms beyond May 15.
