The dollar will decline over the next  two to three years, but this is unlikely to result in a  complete reduction of the U.S. current account deficit, said  Anthony Solomon, chairman of S.G. Warburg (USA) Inc and former  president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
In a presentation to the Japan Society, Solomon said  without elaboration that he expects a "significant decline in  the dollar," within the next three years.
"The dollar will fall more, but the current account deficit  will stop being reduced when it reaches its structural core,"  he said.
For one thing, it is unlikely that there will be any new  investment in those manufacturing industries that shrank when  the dollar was at uncompetitive levels, he said.
