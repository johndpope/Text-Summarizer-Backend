Australia's &lt;Ansett Airlines> will  exercise an option to acquire 20 pct of America West Airlines  Inc &lt;AWAL.O> for about 31.5 mln U.S. Dlrs, &lt;Ansett Transport  Industries Ltd> managing director Peter Abeles said.
Exercise, involving the purchase of about three mln new  America West shares for 10.50 U.S. Dlrs each, was scheduled to  be finalised in July or August, he said in a statement.
Under the terms of the option agreement, Ansett would have  the right to maintain its 20 pct position in the event of  future stock sales, but could not go beyond 20 pct unless so  requested by America West, Abeles said.
America West would retain the right of first refusal if  Ansett offered any of the shares for sale.
