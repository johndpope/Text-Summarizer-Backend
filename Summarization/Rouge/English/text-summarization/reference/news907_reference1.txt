Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said  Japan has no plans to take new emergency measures to support  the dollar, other than foreign exchange intervention.
With the continued fall of the dollar against the yen,  0speculation had arisen in currency markets here that Japan  might take new measures to support the U.S. Currency, such as  curbing capital outflows.
Miyazawa said that yesterday's news of a 4.3 pct rise in  U.S. Gnp in the first quarter had been expected.
Commenting on yesterday's report on economic restructuring  by a high-level advisory panel to Nakasone, Miyazawa said it  was important to put the panel's recommendations into effect.
