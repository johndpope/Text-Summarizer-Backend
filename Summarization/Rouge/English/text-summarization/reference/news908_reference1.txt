Australia's current account deficit for  February is expected to narrow to a range of between 700 mln  and one billion dlrs, from the unrevised January level of 1.29  billion, market economists polled by Reuters said.
The economists said a key element in the narrowing would be  a reversal of the drop in exports which took place in January,  after a sharp rise in December when the deficit was only 598  mln dlrs.
A lack of aircraft imports in February should also  contribute on the trade account although it is still likely to  remain in deficit, the economists said.
