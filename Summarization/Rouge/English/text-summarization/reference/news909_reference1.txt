National Westminster Bank USA said  higher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantial  increase in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise in  first-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reported  a year earlier.
The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction of  income as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual.
Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0  mln a year earlier.
The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for  the remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced  by about 4.9 mln dlrs.
