Capitol Bancorp said it expects to  restate its results for 1986 to a loss of about one mln dlrs  due to a reclassification of loans recommended by auditor Ernst  and Whinney.
The company said the restatement also reflects a  substantial increase in reserves of its principal subsidiary,  Capitol Bank and Trust Co.
It said it expects to earn 2,250,000 to 2,750,000 dlrs for  the first quarter of 1987.
It also said it has delayed its annual meeting until May  due to the restatement of annual earnings.
