Attorney General Edwin Meese said he  saw some benefit in the proposed purchase of American Motors Co  &lt;AMO> By Chrysler Corp &lt;C> in that it would return the smallest  of the U.S. auto manufacturers to American hands.
Meese told the House Appropriations Subcommittee that  consideration would be part of the Justice Department's review  of the proposed merger.
"I think one of the things that has to be recognized in that  merger is that it appears, at least, that a good portion of the  ownership of American Motors, which has been in overseas hands  will be put back in American hands," Meese told the  subcommittee.
