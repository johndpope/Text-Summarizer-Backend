Commerce officials would not say if they found any Canadian  companies had been evading the charge, but that following the  talks they were convinced all exporters were complying with the  agreement.
Undersecretary of Commerce Bruce Smart said "We are  gratified to learn that companies in Canada have begun paying  the export charge on lumber."      He added the agreement was important to the health of the  U.S. lumber industry and he intended to see that it was fully  carried out.
