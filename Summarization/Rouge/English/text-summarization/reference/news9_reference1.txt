General Public Utilities Corp  said its board declared a dividend of 15 cts per share on  common stock, its first dividend since it omitted payment in  February 1980 as a result of the Three Mile Island nuclear  accident in 1979.
The company said it was able to declare the dividend due to  progress in the cleanup of Three Mile Island Unit Two.
A company spokesman said GPU expects to continue declaring  dividends on a quarterly basis, with the rate depending on the  progress of the cleanup and on other company operations.
