Energy Secretary John Herrington  said his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowance  to 27.5 pct was probably the most economically promising way to  spur domestic production.
The option was one of many contained in a report on oil and  the national security the Energy Department sent to the White  House on Tuesday.
Herrington said of the increased depletion allowance  option: "that is one that could significantly increase  production at a very low cost to the American taxpayer."
