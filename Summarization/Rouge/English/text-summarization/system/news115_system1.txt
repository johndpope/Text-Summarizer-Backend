MCI Communications Corp President  Bert Roberts said he expects MCI's financial performance to  improve in the current quarter compared to the previous  quarter.
He said American Telephone and Telegraph Co long-distance  rate cuts had cut into MCI's fourth quarter performance but  added: "There's going to be a continuing impact (on profits) but  we expect this quarter to be better than the fourth quarter."
Roberts said the ATT long-distance rate reductions, which  had been ordered by the Federal Communications Commission have  had "A significantly negative impact on our profits."
