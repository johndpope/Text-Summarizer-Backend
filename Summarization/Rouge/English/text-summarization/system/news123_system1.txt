U.S. Trade Representative Clayton  Yeutter said he was almost sure Japan would not retaliate  against tariffs President Reagan slapped on 300 mln dlrs of  Japanese electronic goods today.
"I'd say it's 99 plus pct sure that it (the tariffs) will  not provoke a retaliation on American products," Yeutter told  Cable News Network.
Earlier today, Reagan   imposed 100 pct tariffs on a range of  Japanese goods in retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of  a bilateral pact governing semiconductor trade.
