Consumer countries should not  intervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas,  Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster said.
"Distribution of export quotas should be in the hands of  producers as has been traditional," Dauster, a delegate at the  recent coffee symposium here, told journalists.
The main consumer country the United States and main  producer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution  when the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) met in  February.
Dauster said Brazil's role when the ICO meets in London in  September will be to support the world coffee pact, defend its  market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the  hands of producer countries.
