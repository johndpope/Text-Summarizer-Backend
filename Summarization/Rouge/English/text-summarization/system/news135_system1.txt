In a speech to the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce,  Clausen said he was "absolutely convinced" BankAmerica would  return to its position of preeminence.
"Fundamental to achieving that goal is to continue to  reduce costs dramatically, to get our arms around our loan loss  problems and begin to reduce charge-offs, and to enhance our  revenue generation," Clausen said.
Clausen said he doubts BankAmerica would be in a position  this year to make any acquisitions or experience any growth.
