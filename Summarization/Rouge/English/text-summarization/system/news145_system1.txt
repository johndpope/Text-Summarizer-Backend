Residents of central Oklahoma  returned to their homes over the weekend after a week of heavy  rains and severe flooding that left two dead and caused more  than 20 mln dlrs in damage, officials said.
Many of the shelters set up throughout the state in areas  threatened by flooding, except those near the Washita and Red  Rivers, closed as residents returned to their damaged homes.
Henry Bellmon, who on Thursday declared a flooding  emergency for central Oklahoma, was expected to ask President  Reagan for federal disaster relief for the area.
