Spain had a 35 mln dlr current account  surplus in February compared with a 68 mln dlr surplus in  January and a 355 mln dlr surplus in February last year, Bank  of Spain figures show.
Spain's trade deficit narrowed to 581 mln dlrs compared  with 664 mln dlrs in January but the large increase in non-oil  imports contributed to the substantial increase over the 159  mln dlr deficit registered in February 1986.
Non-oil imports totalled 2.79 billion dlrs compared with  1.91 billion in February last year, reflecting the large  ammount of investment goods entering the country with the  recovery of the Spanish economy, the Bank of Spain said.
Spain's tourism earnings continued to grow and totalled 655  mln dlrs in February, compared with 103 mln dlrs in January and  502 mln dlrs in February last year.
