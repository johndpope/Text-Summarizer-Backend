Financial and industrial holding company  Nord Est plans to make a convertible bond issue for a total of  400 mln francs, President Gustave Rambaud said.
He said the lower  profit was mainly due to losses made by steel-tube maker  Vallourec, in which Nord Est has a 12.5 pct stake.
Rambaud said he forecast a 1987 parent company net profit  before provisions of around 135 mln francs.
