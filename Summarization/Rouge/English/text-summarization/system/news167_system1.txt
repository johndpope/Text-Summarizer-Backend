Treasury Assistant Secretary David  Mulford said he did not believe that West Germany and Japan  have yet carried out their international responsibilities.
He said that for the U.S. trade deficit to continue  improving in the next two years, "We need more policy actions"  across the entire front of U.S. trade relations, including  Canada and the newly-industrialized countries (NICS).
Mulford also said that OECD nations need to grow an average  three pct to help resolve the international debt crisis.
