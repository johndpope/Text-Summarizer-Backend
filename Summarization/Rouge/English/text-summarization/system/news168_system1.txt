The proposed European Community (EC) tax  on vegetable oils and fats is no longer a major issue on the  agenda and the EC Commission merely used it as a threat, the  West German Feed Stuffs Industry Association (MFI) said.
Association chairman Ulrich Wagner told a news conference  the West German feed industry believes the EC does not  seriously contemplate the introduction of such a tax because it  would end in another transatlantic trade war.
"We have just avoided a trade conflict with the U.S. And the  Commission used the tax threat to calm national farm lobbies."
There are indications the Bonn government will also reject  the proposed tax, Wagner said.
