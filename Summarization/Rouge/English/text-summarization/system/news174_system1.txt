Liberalization of Italy's foreign exchange  controls should be "gradual" but also "reasonably rapid," a report  issued by a study committee nominated by the Italian Treasury  Ministry said.
The report, looking at the country's financial development  prospects, said Italy's large public sector deficit and growing  public debt were among the considerations that made a gradual  liberalization preferable.
The report also favoured retention of the lira's six pct  oscillation band with the European Monetary System (EMS) during  the liberalization process in order to lessen short-term  domestic interest rate fluctuations which could result from  portfolio adjustments.
