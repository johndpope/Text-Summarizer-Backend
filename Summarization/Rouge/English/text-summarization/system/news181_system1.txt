Quantech Electronics Corp said  it is investigating available means of raising additional funds  needed to finance continuing operations, but there is no  assurance that it will succeed.
The company said it continues to experience negative cash  flow.
The company said Marine Midland has agreed to advance it an  additional working capital loan that will be personally  guaranteed by chairman Henry Ginsburg.
