Indonesia's palm oil output is expected  to rise and exports to increase, the U.S. Embassy said in its  annual report on Indonesia's agriculture sector.
The Indonesian government said crude palm oil (CPO) output  is expected to rise to 1.56 mln tonnes in 1987 and 2.11 mln in  1988, up from a projected 1.45 mln tonnes in 1986 and 1.26 mln  in 1985.
The report said the abolition of the five pct CPO export  tax, the devaluation of the rupiah in September 1986 and higher  international palm oil prices should lead to a modest increase  in exports this year.
