Iran has deployed about six large  missiles near the Strait of Hormuz which increase the threat to  shipping in the Gulf, the New York Times said.
It said the missiles had been deployed at two sites and  quoted a naval analyst as saying they could be used to sink a  supertanker and block the Strait of Hormuz.
Missiles now used by Iran had only a fraction of the  explosive power of the Styx and could sink a supertanker only  with a lucky hit, the paper said.
