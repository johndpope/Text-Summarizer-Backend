Skyline Explorations Ltd said expects  construction can begin next month on a gold mine at Johnny  Mountain Camp, located 600 miles north of Vancouver.
The company said a contract has been let for a 200 to 400  tons per day mill and the company is receiving cooperation from  provincial and federal agencies on its stage one report,  "approval in principal," which is required before actual  construction can begin.
Skyline said it is optimistic the approval in principal  will be received in late June, by which time it expects to have  confirmed threshold tonnage and grade targets so construction  can begin in July.
