Cominco Ltd said it set  tentative talks with three striking union locals that rejected  on Saturday a three-year contract offer at Cominco's Trail and  Kimberley, British Columbia lead-zinc operations.
Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down  since the strike started May 9.
Each of the five locals has a separate contract that  expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.
The Trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and  110,000 long tons of lead last year, while the Sullivan mine at  Kimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for  processing at Trail.
