The Bank of Zambia has paid out foreign  exchange arrears from three auctions conducted last year, a  bank spokesman said.
The bank had not paid foreign exchange to private firms  since it suspended the weekly auctions on January 28.
President Kenneth Kaunda announced last month that the  auction would be retained for allocating foreign exchange to  approved private sector bidders, but would not be used to  determine the kwacha's exchange rate.
The government has fixed the exchange rate at nine kwacha  per dollar, effectively revaluing the kwacha by 67.7 pct.
