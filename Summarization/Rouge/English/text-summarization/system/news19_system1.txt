Treasurer Paul Keating forecast  economic growth at slightly under two pct in the financial year  ending June this year, down from the 2.25 pct forecast  contained in the 1986/87 budget delivered last August.
Australia's terms of trade also fell, by 18 pct, over the  past two years, he told Parliament.
Despite the figures, the budget forecast of about 1.75 pct  annual growth in employment would be met, Keating said.
"This government is dragging Australia through a trading  holocaust the kind of which we have not seen since the Second  World War," Keating said.
