American Express Co's stock fell  sharply, reflecting, in part, investors' disappointment that  the company did not make an announcement about its plans for  brokerage unit Shearson Lehman Brothers, traders said.
Traders said many investors anticipated an  announcement this weekend that it would spin off Shearson  Lehman.
Also, they said, a flurry of arbitrage related sell  programs that pounded the general market today accelerated the  selloff of American Express, a component of the Dow Industrial  Average.
