There is little chance Soviet exports  to the United States will rise in 1987, but Moscow's current  trade reforms should result in more trade in manufactured goods  in future, a Soviet economist said.
Sergey Frolov, chief economist at Amtorg Trading Corp, an  agent for Soviet trade organisations and industries, told a  U.S.-USSR business meeting the Soviet Union produces few items  that western nations want.
Frolov said the Soviet Union exported 500 mln dlrs worth of  goods to the United States in 1986 and imported 1.5 billion  dlrs worth.
