The directors of Hughes Tool Co  &lt;HT> said they would recommend to shareholders that they reject  a merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO> today.
Hughes vice-president Ike Kerridge said the recommendation  would be put to shareholders at a meeting scheduled for 10 A.M.  Local time (1600 GMT) to discuss the proposed merger.
Kerridge said the board met yesterday to discuss the merger  but decided against it.
The Hughes board objected to a U.S. Department of Justice  requirement that Baker sell off several specialised  subsidiaries in businesses related to oil-drilling.
The Hughes board last week indicated that it might cancel  the merger because of the Department of Justice requirement.
The companies had been given until April 22 to comply with  the Justice Department requirement, Kerridge said.
