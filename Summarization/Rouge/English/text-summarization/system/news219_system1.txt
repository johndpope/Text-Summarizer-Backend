Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Goria told  the cabinet on Monday he was worried about the increased  tension in the Gulf, but said America's retaliation against  Iran had been limited.
"The prime minister expressed his concern over the possible  consequences of increased tension in the Gulf, at the same time  recognizing the limited character of the American military  reaction to the attacks it has suffered in the past few days,"  the statement said.
Goria said Italy's own ships were far from the platform at  the time of the attack and the fleet had been advised to follow  events with caution.
