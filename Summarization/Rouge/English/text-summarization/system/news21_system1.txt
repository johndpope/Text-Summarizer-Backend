It has been a fairly hectic trading week  in raw sugar with China paying market levels for nearby  shipments, London trader, Woodhouse, Drake and Carey, said in  its weekly report.
July shipment Thai raws traded to China early in the week  at fob levels equivalent to 20/25 points discount to July New  York futures, it said.
Enquiries for July/Sep 15 raw sugars then filtered in and  here again, traded values rose quickly from 13 points premium  to New York July up to 18, Woodhouse said.
