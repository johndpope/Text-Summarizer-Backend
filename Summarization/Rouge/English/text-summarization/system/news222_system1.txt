DNA Medical Inc said Walter G.  Mize had bought about 9,400,000 shares, or about 33 pct of  DNA's outstanding stock, for 100,000 dlrs cash.
Under an agreement with Mize, DNA said he will also become  chairman, and may, at his option, expand the board to provide  him equal representation with the current board.
DNA said that when the transactions are approved by its  shareholders, it will issue additional shares of its common so  that Mize will own 80 pct of its issued and outstanding stock.
DNA said Mize will replace its current chairman, Donald  Holbrook, who will remain on the board.
