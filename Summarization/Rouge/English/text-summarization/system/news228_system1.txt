Institute of International Finance  Managing Director Horst Schulmann said that his orgnaization  has been forecasting further declines of interest rates in the  first half this year and then a levelling off and there is no  reason to change that.
Speaking to reporters, the bank research group said that  the increase in interest rates announced yesterday and other  activity in the foreign exchange markets did not indicate a  fundamental change in the outlook.
The remarks come just before next week's meeting of the  IMF's Interim Committee and the Joint Development Committee of  the IMF and World Bank.
In a letter to the committee's, the bank group said,  "Commercial banks cannot be the dominant supplier of balance of  payments finance."
