President Reagan was ready to impose  retaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking its  semiconductor agreement with the United States, White House  officials said.
There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on  the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb  Japanese exports to the United States, but officials said the  move could come today or early next week.
They said Reaan could also delay invoking sanctions for a  week or two, giving Japan a final opportunity to end the  dumping practice, but added that negotiators had already held  extensive talks with the Japanese to no avail.
