International Platinum Corp said it  signed a letter of intent to enter into further negotiations on  a joint venture exploration agreement with Degussa A.G., of  West Germany, regarding several North American platinum  properties.
Conclusion of the agreement is subject to completion of  further detailed examination by Degussa, as well as board and  regulatory approvals.
Degussa's contribution to the exploration budget will be  based on it matching International Platinum's past exploration  and acquisition costs, estimated at about two mln dlrs, and  then contributing on a pro rata basis, International Platinum  said.
Degussa's contribution would provide a major portion of  International Platinum's exploration budget, especially during  the first and second year of the proposed joint venture, the  company said.
