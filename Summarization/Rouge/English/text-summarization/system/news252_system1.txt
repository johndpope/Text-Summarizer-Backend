Federal Reserve Board governor Robert  Heller said that the dollar's current level is appropriate but  declined to comment on widespread market reports of concerted  central bank intervention this week.
The current level is the  appropriate level," Heller told reporters after a speech to a  meeting of financial services analysts.
Heller also said that it was too early to determine whether  the parties to the six-nation accord were taking appropriate  steps to carry out the longer-term economic adjustments agreed  to in Paris.
