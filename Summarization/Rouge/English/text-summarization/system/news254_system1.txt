The government daily Izvestia said a  considerable amount of Soviet winter crops need to be reseeded  and the state 1987 grain harvest target of 232 mln tonnes will  not be easy to fulfil.
Without giving figures, the newspaper said: "A considerable  part of the winter crops must be reseeded, but that creates  extra effort in the fields in spring."
A U.S. Department of Agriculture analyst in Washington has  said the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about 25 pct  of the total winter crop and would be the second highest  winterkill in 10 years.
"The planned task of bringing in no less than 232 mln tonnes  of grain is not simple," Izvestia said.
