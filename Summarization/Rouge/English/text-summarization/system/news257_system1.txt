The Treasury Department is due to  release funds for the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, to pay  for the coffee purchased from local producers, the IBC said in  a statement.
Gomes said in the statement there have been no problems in  the concession of funds by the Treasury for payment of the  coffee delivered to the IBC warehouses by the producers.
In the future, according to an agreement to be signed with  the Treasury, the Institute will no longer need to seek  approval by the Treasury to seek the release of additional  funds to buy coffee, the statement said.
