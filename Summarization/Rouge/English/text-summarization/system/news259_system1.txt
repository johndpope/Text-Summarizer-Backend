Italy's national airline, Alitalia Spa  &lt;AZPI.MI>, reporting a 14.6 pct rise in provisional 1986 net  profit, said it carried seven pct more passengers on domestic  routes last year, but 11.5 pct fewer passengers on flights from  North America and Canada.
Alitalia said the drop in North American traffic had been  due to a general fall in the numbers of American tourists  visiting Europe caused by fears of terrorism.
