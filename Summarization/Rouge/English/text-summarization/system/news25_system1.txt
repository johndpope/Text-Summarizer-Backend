The Bank of France intervened in the  Paris foreign exchange market this morning for the third  successive day, banking sources said.
Other dealers also reported small-scale intervention to  stabilise the dollar after aggressive selling overnight in  Tokyo, where the Bank of Japan also intervened again.
One major french bank said it bought 10 mln dlrs for the  central bank, selling yen, within a trading range of 148.20/30  yen to the dollar, compared with yesterday's 149.28 rate at  which intervention was carried out here.
