Japan will pay five pct less for the  Indian iron ore it imports in fiscal 1987/88 starting April 1  than the average 18 dlrs a tonne it paid in 1986/87, a  government trade official told Reuters.
He said India had agreed to export to Japan about 23 mln  tonnes of iron ore in 1987/88, about the same as in the current  year.
The official said it was encouraging that Japan had agreed  not to reduce ore imports from India although Japan's total  iron ore imports would be lower in the coming year because of  the recession in the Japanese steel industry.
Government officials said India's total ore exports are  likely to rise to between 33 and 34 mln tonnes in 1987/88,  against a provisionally estimated 31 mln in 1986/87.
