U.S. Trade Representative Clayton  Yeutter said the stock market overreacted to a U.S. decision  last week to proceed with tariffs on some Japanese computer  products.
Speaking to reporters prior to testifying at a House  Agriculture Committee hearing, Yeutter said it is "difficult to  comprehend" that a trade decision affecting only 300 mln dlrs  in goods caused the stock market collapse yesterday.
"We will be glad to have him here, but that's not going to  affect a decision that's already been made," Yeutter said.
