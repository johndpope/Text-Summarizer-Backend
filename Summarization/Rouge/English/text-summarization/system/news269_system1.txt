The European Community Commission has  told EC member states that it is not prepared to discuss EC  sugar prices while sugar traders threaten to make a huge sale  into intervention stocks to protest against its policies,  Commission sources said.
They said French, West German and Dutch officials had  informed the committee that traders in their countries intended  to sell just over 850,000 tonnes of sugar into EC intervention  stocks.
The sources said French traders planned to sell 775,000  tonnes into intervention stocks, West German traders 7,500  tonnes and Dutch traders 2,500.
