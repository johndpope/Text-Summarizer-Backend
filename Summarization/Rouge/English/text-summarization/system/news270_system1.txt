Colombia's coffee export registrations  remain open and there are no plans to close them since a new  marketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered,  Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters'  association said.
Without giving breakdowns, Arango said private exporters  had registered 1,322,804 bags this calendar year up to April 6,  or roughly 440,000 bags per month, slightly lower than the  average in recent years.
He estimated the amount of bags registered by the national  coffee growers' federation at about the same, meaning a total  of about 900,000 bags registered and sold per month by  Colombia.
"The only change that could happen is, because of the  volume, we would be told that from such a date, registrations  would be for June shipment, etc" Arango said.
