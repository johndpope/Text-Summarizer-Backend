The Commerce Department on Monday  will set final dumping duties on frozen orange juice from  Brazil, department officials said.
Commerce's  ruling on Monday will reset the duties on the basis of more  detailed cost information, industry officials said.
The duties now are being assessed on a temporary basis,  pending a final ruling by the U.S. International Trade  Commission (ITC) on whether the imports are injuring the  domestic orange industry.
