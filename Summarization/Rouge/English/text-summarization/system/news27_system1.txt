According to terms, HMO's shareholders would receive a  combination of cash and debt securities to be issued by the  buyer in exchange for their outstanding shares of common and  preferred stock, it said.
Closing of the proposed transaction, if it is completed, is  expected on or before November 2, 1987, it said.
