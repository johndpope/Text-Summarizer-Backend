The climate for precious metals is  improving with prices benefiting from renewed inflation fears  and the switching of funds from dollar and stock markets,  brokers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said.
Silver prices in March gained some 15 pct in dlr terms due  to a weak dollar and silver is felt to be fairly cheap relative  to gold, Montagu said in its monthly silver newsletter.
However silver was less likely to continue to outpace the  other metals by such a margin, Montagu said.
