ConAgra Inc agreed to acquire  Monfort of Colorado Inc in a stock transaction, both companies  said.
The companies said the acquisition will result in a  restatement of ConAgra's earnings for the fiscal year ending  May 31, but the restatement is not expected to materially  change the previously reported, or upcoming, fiscal year-end  earnings.
