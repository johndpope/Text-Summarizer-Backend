The Sichuan government has ordered that  any work or meeting which interferes with the fight against  drought must be cancelled or postponed to save time, energy and  manpower, the People's Daily domestic edition said.
Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily, said the drought, the worst  for more than 20 years, is affecting nearly two mln hectares in  100 counties in Sichuan, the country's biggest agricultural  producer.
The People's Daily said Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Hebei are  also suffering from drought.
Henan's grain output fell by 2.5 mln tonnes last year from  the 1985 level because of drought which has been affecting the  province since May.
