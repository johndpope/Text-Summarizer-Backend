The company said it now has about 22 pct ownership of  Cyclops on a fully diluted basis and expects to proceeds toward  completion of its proposed acquisition of Cyclops.
Last week, before extending its Cyclops offer for one week  at the request of the Securities and Exchange Commission,  Dixons had reported that 54 pct of Cyclops' stock had been  tendered in response to its 90.25 dlrs per share offer which  expired at 2400 EST yesterday.
Yesterday, CAYACQ Corp dropped certain conditions of its  92.50 dlrs a share offer for Cyclops and firmed up the  financing for the proposed transaction.
CAYACQ, an investor  group led by Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and Citicorp, raised  the value of its offer from 80 dlrs per Cyclops share on Friday.
