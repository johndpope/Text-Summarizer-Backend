Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said  that Japan and other industrialized nations committed  themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above  150 yen.
He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that  the six nations have taken measures, including market  intervention, to support the dollar above that level.
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee  that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And  West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar  fell below 150 yen.
Asked if there had been any change in the fundamentals of  each nation since the February 22 Paris accord, he said he did  not think the fundamentals themselves had changed  substantially.
