A meeting of leading politicians,  bankers and economists has forecast Austrian real gross  domestic product growth for this year at between 0.5 and 1.5  pct, a government spokesman said.
Helmut Kramer, spokesman for Chancellor Franz Vranitzky,  told Reuters that the forecast had been made during the meeting  attended by Vranitzky, Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina,  National Bank President Stefan Koren and a WIFO representative.
Kramer also said the meeting had heard that unemployment  for the year would be above the 5.5 pct forecast, but was  unlikely to be more than six pct.
