A Treasury Department spokesman  refused comment on statements by Robert Ortner, undersecretary  of economic affairs for the Commerce Department, that the  Japanese yen was undervalued.
Ortner, senior economist at the Commerce Department, told  an Export-Import Bank conference "the yen is still a little bit  undervalued," and "could go up another 10 or 15 pct."
Ortner, who stressed he was expressing personal views, said  he thought the U.S. dollar was "fairly priced"  against most European currencies and added "I do not regard the  dollar as undervalued at this point against the yen," he said.
But the yen should go up 10 or 15 pct in value, Ortner  said, because it is undervalued against the dollar.
