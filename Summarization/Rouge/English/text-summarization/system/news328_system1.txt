The U.S. Senate on Tuesday backed  President Reagan's retaliatory strike against Iranian targets  in the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy  in the volatile region.
The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S.  resolve that Iran "cannot take military action against the  United States with impunity."
Earlier, the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and  set a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role  in making Gulf policy.
The measure, however, does not require  Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead  to a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf.
