The Belgian National Bank said it cut  one, two, and three month treasury certificate rates, all by  0.10 points, effective immediately.
The cuts take the one month rate to 6.75 pct, the two month  rate to 6.80 pct and the key three month rate to 6.85 pct, the  central bank said in a telex.
A National Bank spokesman said the modest cut was made  after a decline in domestic money market rates yesterday, and  was not expected to be followed by a cut in the 7.60 pct  discount rate.
The short-term treasury certificate rates, and especially  the three-month rate, have been the National Bank's main  monetary policy instrument for the last two years.
