TLX Partners, a group led by Asher  Edelman, does not see any problems with its 65 dlr per share  bid for Telex Corp, a Shearson Lehman official advising the  group said.
The  stock price has changed, but the company hasn't changed so  there's no reason for us to change," said Daniel Good, head of  Shearson Lehman merchant banking.
"Things are proceeding as planned, and we fully expect that  at the time we have to pay for the shares the financing will be  in place," Good said.
