Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige  said he supported efforts to persuade newly-industrialized  countries (NICS) to revalue currencies that are tied to the  dollar in order to help the United States cut its massive trade  deficit.
The U.S. dollar has declined in value against the Yen and  European currencies, but has changed very little against the  currencies of some developing countries such as South Korea and  Taiwan because they are linked to the value of the dollar.
Baldrige told a House Banking subcommittee that the  Treasury Department was attempting to persuade those countries  to reach agreement with the United States on exchange rates.
