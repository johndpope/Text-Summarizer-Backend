U.S. Trade Representative Clayton  Yeutter said that whether the exchange rate of the dollar would  fall or rise in the coming decade would depend on nations'  financial, monetary and tax policies.
But, he said, in a speech and remarks to the Heritage  Foundation, that in the end "the marketplace will ultimately  rule the day."
Yeutter said "if nations do the right kinds of things in  financial, monetary and tax policies, then a lesser burden of  adjustment is placed on exchange rates, and one could envision  a situation of the major trading nations moving back far closer  to what most of us would consider equilibrium and exchange  rates becoming relatively stable."
