The Association of White Metals has  decided to publish a daily tin price here in French francs per  100 kilos, the French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals said.
The International Chamber of Commerce stopped publishing a  tin price after the London Metal Exchange (LME) stopped tin  trading on October 24, 1985.
The French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals groups various  metal associations including the Association of White Metals.
