The 1.4 mln tonnes capacity bauxite  refinery at Paranam in Surinam, which closed at the end of  January after being sabotaged by anti-government rebels, has  now reopened, a spokesman for Dutch metals company Billiton  said.
Earlier, the refinery had had to import some supplies of  bauxite, as rebel activity shut off supplies from Alcoa's mine  at Moengo in the east of the country.
Billiton's mine at Onverdacht, between Paranam and the  capital Paramaribo, is still working but Moengo remains closed  and the refinery is continuing to import some bauxite, the  Billiton spokesman said.
