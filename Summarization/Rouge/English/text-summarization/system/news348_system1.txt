CTC Dealer Holdings Ltd said &lt;Canadian  Tire Corp Ltd> controlling shareholders Alfred, David and  Martha Billes did not extend an agreement expiring yesterday to  tender their shares only to CTC's previously reported offer for  49 pct of Canadian Tire common shares.
CTC, which already holds 17.4 pct of Canadian Tire common,  said it would therefore not take up any shares tendered under  its offer unless they totaled at least 1.1 mln or another 32.7  pct of Canadian Tire common.
CTC, a group of Canadian Tire dealers, said it expected to  know by May 11 if it would obtain approval to appeal a  previously reported Ontario court ruling upholding a regulatory  decision to block CTC's offer.
