Abnormally warm and dry weather over most  parts of China is seriously affecting crops, the New China News  Agency said.
It said the drought has made rice planting difficult in  eight provinces, including Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan.
The agency said some areas of Guangxi, Hubei, Shanxi and  other provinces have been suffering a drought for more than  seven months.
The agency said the dry weather had reduced the amount of  water stored by more than 20 pct compared with last March,  lowered the water level of many rivers, reduced hydroelectric  power supplies and caused water shortages for industry and  consumers.
