The Bank of France said it cut its money  market intervention rate to 7-3/4 pct from eight pct when it  injected money against first category paper.
The bank also cut its seven-day repossession rate to 8-1/2  pct from 8-3/4 pct.
The intervention rate has stood at eight pct since it was  raised from 7-1/4 pct on January 2 as the French franc came  under pressure ahead of the EMS realignment on January 11.
Money market dealers said conditions seemed right for a  quarter percentage point cut, reflecting an easing in the call  money rate last week, and the French franc's steadiness on  foreign exchange markets since the February 22 currency  stabilisation accord here by the Group of Five and Canada.
