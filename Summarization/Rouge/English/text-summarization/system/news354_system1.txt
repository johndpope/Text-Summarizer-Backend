Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ali  al-Khalifa al-Sabah said in a newspaper interview that no OPEC  member was exceeding oil production quotas allocated by the  13-nation group.
Some oil industry sources had said the United Arab  Emirates, which had been generally been producing over its  quota since OPEC returned to quotas last September, was still  pumping more than its allotted amount in the first months of  this year.
