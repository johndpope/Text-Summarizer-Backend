The State Department says many U.S.  diplomatic missions overseas are on high alert for possible  retaliation from Iran for Monday's attack on two Iranian oil  platforms by American forces in the Gulf.
"The threat to Americans has increased significantly," she  said in announcing that the department was reiterating advice  it last made in January.
Oakley said no specific warning has been issued to U.S.  diplomats and Americans living abroad in the aftermath of the  U.S. attack on the oil drilling platforms, but "many of our  missions are on a high state of alert."
