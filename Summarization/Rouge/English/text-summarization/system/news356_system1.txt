&lt;AB Catena>, in which AB Volvo  &lt;VOLV.ST> has a 48 pct stake, said it was proposing a  two-for-five stock issue that will raise the company's equity  capital to 420 mln crowns from 300 mln.
Catena's increase in sales was mainly due to the takeover  of Safveans AB in February 1986, which changed the business  profile of Catena.
This yielded a  profit of 386.7 mln crowns and was reflected in Catena's  pre-tax earnings which rose to 724 mln crowns from 204 mln in  1985.
