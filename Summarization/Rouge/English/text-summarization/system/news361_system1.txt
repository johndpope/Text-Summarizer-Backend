Secretary of Agriculture Richard  Lyng will meet with representatives from major grain exporting  companies today, and the subject of subsidized wheat to the  Soviet Union will likely be discussed, an aide to Lyng said.
Today's meeting, set to begin at 1500 EST (2000 gmt), was  scheduled at the request of the exporters, the aide said.
"The EEP (export enhancement program) is pretty obviously  one of the things they (the exporters) want to talk about, but  they haven't any agenda as far as I know," Lyng's aide said.
Private industry export officials have met periodically  with Lyng to discuss farm policies and the export situation.
Whether this meeting will prompt any U.S. action on the issue  of whether Moscow will be offered export bonus wheat is  uncertain, the aide said.
