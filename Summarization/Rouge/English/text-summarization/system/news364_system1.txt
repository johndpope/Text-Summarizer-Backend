House Ways and Means Committee  Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back  the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support.
However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates  enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged.
Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his  1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax  increases.
On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect the  major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry  for special protection.
