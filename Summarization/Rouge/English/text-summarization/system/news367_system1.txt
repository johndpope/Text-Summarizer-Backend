Timber Realization Co said it has  agreed to sell its remaining 50,000 acres of timberland  property in Mississippi for about 11.3 mln dlrs in cash.
Timber Realization, a limited partnership formed to dispose  of timberlands and related properties transferred to it by the  &lt;Masonite Corp>, said that when this sale is completed the  partnership will have received about 15.2 mln dlrs in cash and  notes from the sale of its properties since December 23, 1986.
Prior to that date, the partnership said it expects to form  a liquidating trust to provide for unresolved claims and  liablities.
Timber Realization said the amount retained in that trust  will depend on its experience in resolving open items up to the  termination date, but it added it expects to retain a  substantial amount in the trust.
