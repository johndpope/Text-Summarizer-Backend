The Kuwait Central Bank kept its window  for funds to the domestic interbank deposit market shut as  banks returned from a four day holiday, dealers said.
Bankers see the suspension of central bank aid as a  deliberate move to drive up Kuwaiti dinar interest rates and  stem a flow of funds out of the country, where market  nervousness is increasing over the growing tension in the Gulf.
Today's rate was reduced to 0.27939/73 to the dollar from  0.27758/92 on Wednesday before the four day bank holiday that  celebrated the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.
