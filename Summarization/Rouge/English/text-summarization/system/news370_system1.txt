Gruppo Ferruzzi is studying a  project which could result in a public share offer of up to 49  pct of its French unit European Sugar (France) and could raise  around 400 mln dlrs, Ferruzzi chairman Raul Gardini said.
European Sugar, wholly-owned by Ferruzzi unit Eridania  Zuccherifici Nazionali SpA, is expected to absorb the European  corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc which  Ferruzzi recently agreed to buy.
A Ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group was  studying the transfer of the CPC business to European Sugar  along with a possible share offering in the Paris unit, but  gave no details.
