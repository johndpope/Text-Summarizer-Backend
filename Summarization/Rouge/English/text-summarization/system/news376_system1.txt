Fifteen countries in Eastern and  Southern Africa have agreed to cut tariffs on regional trade by  10 pct every two years up to 1996.
A statement by the Preferential Trade Area (PTA), which  seeks to create a common market stretching from Ethiopia in the  north to Lesotho in the south, said the governments would make  the first tariff cut next year.
In 1996 they would assess the impact of the tariff  reductions and work out a new timetable for the complete  elimination of all barriers to trade by the year 2000.
