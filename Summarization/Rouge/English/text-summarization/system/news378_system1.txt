Centel Corp said it sees 1987 first  quarter results below those of 1986 due to regulatory limits on  telephone earnings and 15 cts to 20 cts a share dilution from  1986 acquisitions.
In the annual report, Chairman Robert Reuss told  shareholders telephone profits will continued to be limited by  ceilings imposed by regulators as well as deregulation and  structural changes within the industry that have slowed growth  in the investment base for setting rates.
"Several of the company's telephone units may be faced with  a reduction in the rates of return authorized by their  regulators," Reuss said.
Reuss said he is encouraged by the prospects for progress  in Centel's business communications, cable television and  cellular telephone units.
