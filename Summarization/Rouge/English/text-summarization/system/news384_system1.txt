The Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand  outlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese  energy demand, ministry officials said.
The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in  Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen  and a decline in domestic electric power demand.
MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand  outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the  Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.
They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy  supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.
Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric power  in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27  pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and  liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.
