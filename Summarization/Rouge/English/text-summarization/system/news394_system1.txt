"It's disappointing to spend so much time on these  negotiations and have them fail," said FCS chairman Nicholas  Gallo III.
"But the discussions could not produce a deal  acceptable to our board in the context of the company's  stronger financial position today as compared to six months  ago."
Gallo said FCS will stop actively seeking potential merger  partners, but will respond to serious inquiries.
"We are determined to follow our plan to restore this  company to profitability," he said.
The company, which has 4,475,930 common shares outstanding,  reaffirmed it expects to be profitable in the second half of  the fiscal year ending September 30, 1987.
