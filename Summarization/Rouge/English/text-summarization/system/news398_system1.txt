Jacobs Suchard AG expects a world cocoa  surplus of around 100,000 tonnes in 1987 compared with a  104,000 tonne surplus in 1986, Jens Sroka, head of commodity  buying, told a news conference.
Unless reason prevails and the major producers return to  the conference table, the world coffee market will remain free  and the consequences for some producers dependant on coffee for  their foreign exchange earnings would be catastrophic, Sroka  added.
