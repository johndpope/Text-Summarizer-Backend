The Development Bank of Singapore Ltd  (DBS) said Malaysia's real gross domestic product growth (gdp)  in 1987 could be 1.5 to two pct, above a budget target of one  pct.
It said in a report that because of an economic recovery  and higher foreign exchange reserves, the Malaysian ringgit is  unlikely to face devaluation in the near future.
The report said rising commodity prices and the continued  expansion of the manufacturing sector coupled with rigorous  fiscal restraints and a more stable currency are grounds for  cautious optimism about the Malaysian economy.
It forecast the ringgit will remain stable at between 2.60  and 2.70 Malaysian dlrs to the U.S. Dollar for the rest of the  year.
But the report said the growth rate of Malaysia's external  debt remains worrying and should be controlled.
