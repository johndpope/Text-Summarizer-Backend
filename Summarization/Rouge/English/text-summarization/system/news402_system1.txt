The relatively high level of real U.S.  interest rates suggests that there is scope for further  declines in money market rates, but the Federal Reserve is  unlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains  volatile, said J.P. Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston.
He said in response to a reporter's question after the  bank's annual meeting that money market rates could decline  further but, "I don't think the Fed is going to encourage that  as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are."
