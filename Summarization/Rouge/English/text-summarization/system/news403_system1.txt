Shifts from mild to very cold  weather in East Germany damaged winter barley and late sown  winter wheat in central regions and barley north of Berlin, the  U.S. agricultural officer in East Berlin said.
The officer said heavy frosts at night followed by sunshine  during the day led to some heaving, particularly for well  developed plants and for winter barley.
