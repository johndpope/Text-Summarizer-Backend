Maoist guerrillas using dynamite derailed  two locomotives and four train wagons, interrupting traffic on  Peru's sole railway line linking the capital to the central  Andes, where most of the country's mining centres are located,  authorities said.
Damages was estimated at 800,000 dlrs in the dynamite blast  yesterday at Chacapalca, where the explosion wrecked the train  laden with minerals and 45 metres of the railway line.
Crews hoped to restore traffic to the line later today  after clearing the damaged train and repairing the tracks at  Chacapalca, 225 km east of the Capital, Lima.
Most of the minerals,  extracted and refined in the central peruvian andes, are  shipped down the central railway to the lima port of callao.
