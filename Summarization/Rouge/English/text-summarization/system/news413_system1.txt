Wheat and rapeseed crops in east China  suffered considerable damage because of frost during a spell of  unusually cold weather in late March, the China Daily said.
Heavy snow blanketted central and south Jilin and north  Liaoning, leaving farmland too muddy for spring ploughing and  sowing, the paper said.
The paper said rainfall during the last 10 days of March in  areas south of the Yangtze had been much higher than normal.
Heavy rain fell last Sunday in parts of Guangdong, ending a  particularly arid dry season and marking the start of the flood  season, it said.
The New China News Agency said rain and snow in Henan had  improved the prospects for wheat, sown on 4.8 mln hectares, and  caused a drop in grain prices at rural fairs since late  February.
