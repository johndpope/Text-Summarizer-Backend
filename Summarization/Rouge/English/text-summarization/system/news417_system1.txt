Lucas Industries Plc &lt;LUCS.L> said its  underlying performance would continue to improve in the second  half but profits would be restrained by low activity in U.K.  Commercial vehicle and tractor markets as well as in North  American electronics.
Costs of restructuring, reorganisation, employee training  and retraining, particularly in the UK automotive businesses,  together with high research and development spending would  affect profits in the short term.
But Lucas said it was exploiting growth opportunities in  automotive markets, especially in vehicle breaking and engine  management systems.
Recent acquisitions in North America had  strengthened Lucas Aerospace and Lucas Industrial systems.
