J.C. Penney Co's stock rose sharply   after analyst William Smith of Smith Barney recommended the  stock, based on the company's strong earnings momentum and the  possibility of a stock buyback, dividend hike or stock split,  traders said.
"I am very impressed with the strong basic earnings story,"  analyst Smith said, noting that the company has "fine tuned its  buying and inventories, and has admirably controlled costs in a  time that they needed to."
