Dutch chemicals group Akzo  NV &lt;AKZO.AS> said it hoped to consolidate its core activities  this year by making small acquisitions in the US.
Akzo chairman Aarnoud Loudon told a news conference on its  1986 report that the company wanted to achieve the same level  of US investments it had before it divested its fibre firm  American Enka in December 1985, when US investments represented  20 pct of Akzo's total capital.
Despite its highly liquid cash flow, Akzo did not plan  acquisitions on a scale that would negatively influence the  company's debt/equity ratio, Loudon said.
The chairman said in the past two years Akzo had spent 1.1  billion guilders on acquisitions, of which nearly two thirds  were in the United States.
