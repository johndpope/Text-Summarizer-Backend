Van Leeuwen said that due partly to the fact Europeesche  made losses in 1985 and 1986, the 20 pct stake was obtained at  below the shares' intrinsic value.
The Europeesche, which specialises in travel and recreation  insurance, had a premium income of 150 mln guilders in 1986.
Europeesche made a loss of nine mln guilders in 1985, which  narrowed to 4.5 mln guilders in 1986, van Leeuwen said.
