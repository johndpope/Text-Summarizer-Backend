The Agriculture Ministry declined comment  on a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks  on its closed rice market in the new GATT round.
Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources,  said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng  and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its  intentions.
The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue  at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  talks.
Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries about  mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japan  will try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is  justified, it said.
