T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman and  financier, said he believes the heady days the oil service  industry had in the early 1980s, when over 4,500 oil rigs were  once reported operating, will not return in his lifetime.
Pickens told Reuters he expects the rig count to drop to  below 600 before recovering.
Currently, some 700 oil rigs are operating in the U.S.,  down sharply after oil prices slipped from 30 dlrs in late 1985  to around 10 dlrs in 1986.
"The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil  gets above 30 dlrs," he said, adding that while he expects to  see 50 dlr a barrel oil, he does not expect to see 2,000 rigs  operating in his lifetime.
