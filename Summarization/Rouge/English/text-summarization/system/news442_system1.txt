Alcan Aluminium Ltd said it joined with  Carrozzeria Bertone S.P.A. to exhibit Alcan's technology in  aluminum structured vehicles at Geneva's international auto  salon.
Alcan said it and Bertone have built several Bertone X1/9  sports cars with structures of adhesively bonded sheet  aluminum.
Alcan said two of the cars are currently being tested in  Britain by the Motor Industry Research Association.
Alcan said the technology, which reduces the weight of a  car's basic structure by up to 50 pct, can improve handling and  performance and reduce fuel consumption for any size car.
The structure provides the same stiffness and safety as  present materials, while continuously bonded seams allow a 65  pct reduction in spot welds, Alcan said.
