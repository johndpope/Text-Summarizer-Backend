Kloeckner &amp; Co KGaA, the  international trading group, said its 1986 domestic group net  profit fell by around 20 pct against 1985, adding that the  profit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves.
The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted a  domestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985.
Kloeckner's nominal 100 mark profit-participation  certificates, issued in October 1986, will pay a likely yield  of around 10 pct.
