Saudi riyal interbank deposit rates  surged across the board as banks tried to build long positions  in anticipation of a further rise in U.S. Interest rates,  dealers said.
They said traders expected riyal deposits to follow the  recent strong rise in eurodollar rates sparked by fears of a  tighter U.S. Monetary policy to halt the dollar's slide.
"There was a wave of panic buying early in the morning as  people tried to cover gaps and build long riyal positions," said  one dealer.
Spot-next and one-week deposits  climbed to 6-5/8, 1/8 pct from 6-3/8, six on Sunday.
One-month deposits rose to 6-1/2, 3/8 pct from 6-1/4, six  and three-month deposits climbed to 6-3/4, 5/8 pct from 6-9/16,  7/16.
