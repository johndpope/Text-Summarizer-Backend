The leaders of two of Japan's top business  groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7)  accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to  Japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the  yen's current level as appropriate.
Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for  Economic Development, said the accord will not prevent the yen  from rising further.
