British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher  said she and Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov had set targets for  increased trade between the two countries during talks earlier  today.
She said she hoped more economic exchanges between Britain  and the Soviet Union "will also lead to increased friendship and  increased understanding."
Earlier, she told a meeting of Soviet and British  businessmen that she had agreed with Ryzhkov that they would  work to achieve a total volume of 2.5 billion roubles in  bilateral trade by 1990.
"Mr Ryzhkov handed me a list of import and export  opportunities which I hope you will all jump at," she told the  meeting to mark the opening of new offices of the British-  Soviet Chamber of Commerce.
