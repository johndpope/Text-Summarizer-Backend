Japan is disappointed at the recent threats  of trade retaliation from the European Community (EC) just as  the trade situation between the two is improving, Japanese  Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura said.
"I am deeply concerned that the EC has moved to take a  harsher line toward Japan despite this tangible improvement," he  said in a speech prepared for delivery at the opening of a new  centre designed to improve understanding between the two sides.
"While I do not deny the existence of the trade deficit  between Japan and the EC, I believe it should be rectified not  by reducing trade through import restrictions or export  restraints, but by expanding the (overall) trade," Tamura said.
