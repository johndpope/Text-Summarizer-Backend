China has raised the prices it pays  farmers for cotton, edible oil, sugar cane and beets to reverse  a decline in output in 1986, He Kang, Minister of Agriculture,  Animal Husbandry and Fisheries said.
He said the state will increase investment in agriculture  and supplies of fertiliser, diesel oil and other production  materials and stabilise fertiliser and diesel oil prices.
He said China aims to produce between 425 and 450 mln  tonnes of grain by 1990, up from a target of 405 mln this year  and an actual 391 mln last year.
