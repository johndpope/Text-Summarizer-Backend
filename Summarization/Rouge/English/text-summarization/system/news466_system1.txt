Loans and advances from the Dutch  Central Bank to the commercial banks fell 1.01 billion guilders  to 9.5 billion guilders in the week ending March 30, the Bank's  weekly return showed.
Dealers said payments by the Dutch state, partly in the  form of civil service wages, had outweighed payments to the  State, causing the money market deficit to ease.
The Treasury's account with the Bank dropped 960 mln  guilders to 6.5 billion guilders.
