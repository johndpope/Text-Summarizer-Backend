Work will begin on April 3 and the company aims to increase  output to 10 tonnes within a decade to pay off Pyongyang's 70  billion yen debt to 30 Japanese companies, Li added.
The mine, started in 1896 by a U.S. Company, is one of six  or seven virtually untapped mines in the Unzan area, 94 miles  north of Pyongyang, Li said.
"Up to now, the mining was done with antiquated  methods and basic equipment."
Earlier this year, Pyongyang tried and failed to pay off  part of its debt with several tonnes of fish.
