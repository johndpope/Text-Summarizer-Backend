Burma's debt service ratio will have  fallen to 48.8 pct in the fiscal year to end-March 1987 from 50  pct in 1985-1986, the official Council of People's Inspectors  (CPI) reported.
Debt servicing cost Burma 1.62 billion kyats in 1985-1986  while foreign exchange earnings -- export revenues plus loans  and aid -- totalled 3.23 billion kyats in the same period, the  council said.
Burma, which diplomats here say now has foreign debts of up  to 3.4 billion dlrs, has applied to the United Nations to be  reclassified as one of the world's least developed countries in  order to qualify for softer loan and grant aid.
