The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the  fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986  cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the  value of the dollar, the institute said in a report.
The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the  course of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a  whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the  first part of 1987.
