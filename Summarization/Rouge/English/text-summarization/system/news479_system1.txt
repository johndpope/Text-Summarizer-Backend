The recent deterioration in the  steel market makes it important for Arbed SA &lt;ARBB.BR> to  maintain efforts to reduce costs, the company said in a  statement.
It reported that its competitive position had weakened  considerably in the second half of 1986, leading to a seven pct  cut in steel output over the whole of the year to 3.74 mln  tonnes.
Arbed said the early months of 1987 had seen the market  deteriorate further, but the decision of the European Community  to maintain anti-crisis measures, at least provisionally,  should under normal circumstances have a beneficial effect.
Arbed said in current conditions, cost cutting efforts  remain necessary to avoid any weakening of resources which have  been built up over the last three years.
