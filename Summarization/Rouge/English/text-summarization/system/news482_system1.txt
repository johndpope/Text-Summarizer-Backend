First Interstate Bancorp Chairman  Joseph Pinola said the bank holding company would lose about 16  mln dlrs per year, after taxes, if it had to put its medium and  long-term debt on non-accrual status.
Pinola said First Interstate, like other banks, has not yet  decided to put the loans, which Brazil stopped paying interest  on last month, on non-accrual status.
First Interstate reported to the Securities and Exchange  Commission last week that it has about 339 mln dlrs in  medium-to long-term loans to Brazil.
It said on December 31, 1986 its nonperformind Brazilian  outstanding debt totaled about 4.1 mln dlrs.
