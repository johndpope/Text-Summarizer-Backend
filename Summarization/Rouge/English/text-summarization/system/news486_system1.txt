In a letter to Treasury Secretary James Baker the group  said sanctions should be imposed against Japanese chipmakers as  of April 1 and should continue until the United States is  satisfied that there is full compliance with the agreement.
"America's interests require that agreements be honored and  that U.S. industries not bear the burden for the persistent  unwillingness or inability of the government of Japan to  deliver on its commitments," the trade group said.
The trade group said Japan has not lived up to the terms of  the agreement last year which was aimed at ending Japanese  dumping of semiconductors and at opening Japanese markets to  foreign-based manufacturers.
