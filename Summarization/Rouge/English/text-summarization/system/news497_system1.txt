British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher  denied in an interview published in Saudi Arabia today that her  government's oil policy contributed to weakness in world oil  prices.
She said the government was determined not to intervene to  influence production decisions by oil companies operating in  the North Sea.
"We believe these must be a matter for the commercial  judgment of the oil companies," she told the Arabic language  daily al-Sharq al-Awsat in an interview coinciding with a visit  to London by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
Thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall  in oil prices as North Sea production was now about the same as  in 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel.
