Dominican Alfredo Ricart will take over  as executive director of the International Sugar Organization  (ISO) in mid-April, ISO officer in charge Constantin Politoff  said.
Once this is done, time can be dedicated to working towards  a new International Sugar Agreement (ISA) with economic  clauses, he said.
Ricart, currently the Dominican Republic's ambassador to  Austria, the Netherlands and the UN in Geneva, said he will  visit the four major exporters - Australia, Brazil, Cuba and  the European Community - to talk to governments and producers  and find out about problems that are preventing these countries  finding common ground for a new sugar pact.
