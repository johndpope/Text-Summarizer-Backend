Beaver Creek State Bank in Beaver  Creek, Minn., failed and the bank's insured assets were  transferred to Citizens State Bank of Silver Lake, Minn., the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said.
The transfer was arranged because there were no bids to buy  Beaver Creek, the FDIC said.
Citizens will pay a premium of 30,000 dlrs  to the FDIC and  purchase Beaver Creek's assets for 5.3 mln dlrs.
The new association is to be known as Victor Savings and  Loan Association and its assets continue to be insured by the  Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp, the FHLBB said.
