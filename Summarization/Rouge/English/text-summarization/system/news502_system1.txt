Whether the European Community's  Council of Ministers will approve a proposed tax on vegetable  oils that has sparked threats of U.S. retaliation is uncertain,  an EC official said.
U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has threatened  retaliation if the tax is approved, as it would limit U.S.  soybean exports to the EC.
Denman said while the EC is willing to negotiate about  agriculture in a new round of trade talks, it is unwilling to  single out export subsidies on a negotiating agenda or put  agricultural policy on a special fast track.
"The key to a solution in this area seems to me not in the  framing of the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)  wording...but in tackling government subsidies to farmers on  both sides of the Atlantic," he said.
