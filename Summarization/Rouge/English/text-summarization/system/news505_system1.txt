Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc  said it has told Harper and Row Publishers Inc representatives  that it intends to withdraw its proposal to acquire Harper and  Row for 50 dlrs per share in cash if the parties have not made  satisfactory progress in discussions by the close of business  on March 30.
Harcourt Brace said, "We do not wish to put undue pressure  on Harper and Row, but we also, in fairness to our own  shareholders, cannot allow an offer of such magnitude to lie on  the table too long."
