Japan was ready to use diplomacy to help  maintain the security of the Gulf, Prime Minister Yasuhiro  Nakasone said.
But he told reporters Japan should not cut its lines of  communication with Iran and Iraq because its policy was to take  a broad political stance.
Officials of the foreign ministry  said Japan had maintained good relations with both Iran and  Iraq, which have been at war since September 1980.
Last week Nakasone ruled out Japanese military or financial  help to patrol the waters of the Gulf.
