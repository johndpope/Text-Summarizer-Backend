Bank of Canada Governor John Crow said he  expects the Canadian economy will grow moderately in the coming  year, despite the near flat growth in the final quarter of  1986.
"We see moderate growth," Crow told a news conference  following presentation of the central bank's annual report in  the House of Commons today.
He said there were positive signs of growth in the economy,  particularly the drawdown of business inventories in the fourth  quarter.
"It (the debt problem) is not a happy development but I  think it can be overplayed in terms of its impact," Crow told  reporters.
