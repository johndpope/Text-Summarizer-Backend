Spanish farm minister Carlos Romero,  speaking at a meeting of EC farm ministers, called for action  to help the Spanish maize market, Spanish diplomatic sources  said.
They said the imports are due to come in as a result of the  accord by which the EC has promised the United States it will  import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum  into Spain from third countries this year.
The sources said Romero urged that other EC countries  should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the  Spanish market.
They said he threatened to withhold support for the EC  Commission plan for new limits on farm output which if breached  would mean price cuts unless Spain received some help.
