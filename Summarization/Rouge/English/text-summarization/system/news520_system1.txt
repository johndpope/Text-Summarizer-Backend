Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> said it regrets its  plan to enter the U.K. Business facsimile and telephone market  may be caught up in a diplomatic row over the position of Cable  and Wireless Plc's &lt;CAWL.L> in the Japanese market.
"As a matter of timing it is regrettable that this has been  linked with the question of market access in Japan," a Toshiba  spokesman told Reuters.
&lt;Toshiba Information Systems (U.K.) Ltd>, a Toshiba  subsidiary, said yesterday it planned to enter the U.K. Market  under the Toshiba own brand name and had applied for government  approval to do so.
The Toshiba spokesman said the sale of such equipment was  not comparable to Cable and Wireless' efforts to take a stake  in the new Japanese telecommunications firm.
