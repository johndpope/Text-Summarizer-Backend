Ashland Oil Inc said it expects to  report a loss from operations in the second quarter.
The company also said it expects to report a 10 mln dlrs  net gain in the quarter from excess pension funds used to pay  down debt.
"However, it is difficult to determine now whether  this gain will be sufficient to offset the expected operating  loss," the company said in a statement.
