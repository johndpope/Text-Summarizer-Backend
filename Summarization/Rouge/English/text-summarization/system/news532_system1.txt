Banks in Hong Kong are likely to raise  prime rates by half a percentage point to 6-1/2 pct following a  one-quarter point prime rate increase by two major U.S. Banks  yesterday, dealers said.
Goh, chief dealer of the Standard Chartered Bank, said  prime rate increases by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank to  7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 may prompt Hong Kong banks to follow suit.
Goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 6-1/2  pct, the level at beginning of 1987.
The banks raised the prime to the current six pct from five  pct on February 28 after cutting it 1-1/2 points from 6-1/2 on  January 15 in response to upside pressure on the Hong Kong  dollar, he said.
