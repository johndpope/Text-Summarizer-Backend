Kuwait has agreed to charter tankers  from the Soviet Union in a move to protect its oil exports  through the Mideast Gulf, diplomatic sources said.
They said the agreement followed months of talks with the  Soviet Union and the U.S. On ways to secure its oil exports  after Iran started to attack Kuwaiti-connected vessels in  retaliation for Kuwait's backing for Iran's war enemy Iraq.
The diplomats said they knew of no deal for Moscow to  provide a naval escort for its own vessels, but "the idea of  protection is implicit," one said.
They said Soviet cargo ships bound for Kuwait in the past  to unload arms and materiel for road delivery to Iraq were  known to have sailed under escort.
