&lt;Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd>  (MMAL) reported a 19.64 mln dlr net loss in calendar 1986 from  a 5.80 mln dlr profit in 1985 on turnover of 837.79 mln dlrs  from 942.89 mln.
MMAL, 99 pct-owned by Mitsubishi Motors Corp &lt;MIMT.T> and  Mitsubishi Corp &lt;MITT.T>,  said a tight market meant it had  failed to recover 19 mln dlrs in costs sustained because of a  weak Australian dollar.
The company said its Magna car dominated its market segment  with sales of 30,500 units against 26,900 in 1985.
In addition, export of components to Japan increased with  15 mln dlrs invested in 1986 to expand output of aluminium  cylinder heads to 26,000 per month from 6,000, MMAL said.
Australian car sales fell to 530,000 in 1985 from 696,000  in 1985, although MMAL said it lifted its market penetration to  12.1 pct from 11.5 pct.
