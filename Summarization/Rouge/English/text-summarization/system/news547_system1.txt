The U.S. Agriculture Department  increased its estimate of Soviet 1986/87 grain imports to 26  mln tonnes from last month's projection of 23 mln tonnes.
In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook, USDA said  the increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to the  U.S. corn market and continued purchases of both wheat and  coarse grain from other major suppliers.
USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes, up one  mln from last month's estimate and 700,000 tonnes below the  preliminary 1985/86 figure.
