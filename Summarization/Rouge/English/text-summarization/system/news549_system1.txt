Discussions on the possible extension of  the sixth International Tin Agreement (ITA) began at the  quarterly session of the International Tin Council (ITC) but  the Council is still waiting for decisions from various member  states.
Delegates said it could be Friday before all the member  countries declare their positions on the possible extension.
The council reconvenes at 0930 GMT tomorrow, although  delegates said the morning is likely to be taken up with minor  technical matters and the main issue will probably not be  discussed before the afternoon session.
