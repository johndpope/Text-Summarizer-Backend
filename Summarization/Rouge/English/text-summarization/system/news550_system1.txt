Copper shipments are likely to be  delayed because of power problems at &lt;Philippine Associated  Smelting and Refining Corp> (PASAR), the country's only  smelter, a company official said.
The New York trade sources said if PASAR's shipments were  delayed, customers might have to turn to the London Metal  Exchange for supply.
A spokeswoman for the Chamber of Mines said Philippine  copper production amounted to 222,644 tonnes in 1986, down  slightly from 226,157 tonnes in 1985.
