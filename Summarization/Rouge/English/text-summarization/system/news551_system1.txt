The West German government expressed  support for the U.S.
Position in opposing the proposed European  Community tax on vegetable oils and fats, a U.S. Embassy  spokesman said.
The spokesman, speaking from Bonn, said, "We have good  reason to think West Germany holds to its resistance to the  proposed tax."
European agriculture was facing severe problems, but both  the Community and the U.S. Should work closely within the  framework provided by the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade, he said.
The EC and the U.S. Realised the tax issue would stay on  the agenda for several months and there were indications that  both sides would have to prepare for some tough negotiations,  the spokesman said.
