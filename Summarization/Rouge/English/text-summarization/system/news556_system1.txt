Lynch Corp said it will offer 10.50 dlrs  a share in cash, 4.50 dlrs in subordinated debentures and a 1/4  share in a new company for each Becor Western Inc share  outstanding.
Lynch said its proposed offer "substantially improves" over  the offer of 10.45 dlrs a share in cash and 4.00 dlrs of senior  sinking fund debentures made by BCW Acquisition Inc, formed by  Becor's management.
Lynch Chairman Mario Gabelli, who heads a group which owns  12.35 pct of Becor's 16.5 mln outstanding shares, said the  Lynch bid "is about one dlr better than the present offer."
Following sale of Becor's aerospace subsidiary in February,  the management group led by President William Winter announced  plans for a 238.1 mln dlr leveraged buyout.
