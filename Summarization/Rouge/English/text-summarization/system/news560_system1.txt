The Indonesian rupiah has held steady  since its 31 pct devaluation against the dollar six months ago,  but has slipped against the mark and to a lesser extent against  the yen, according to central bank figures.
Today's middle rate per 100 yen was 1,129.78 against  1,075.20 at end-February and 1,058.6 at devaluation in  September.
Bank Indonesia's quoted rate for the dollar, the main  currency for Indonesia's oil and gas exports, was 1,644.0  today, the same rate fixed at the time of devaluation.
The value of the rupiah is set daily against a basket of  currencies by the central bank.
The rise in the value of the mark and the yen has hit  Indonesia by increasing its debt servicing levels.
