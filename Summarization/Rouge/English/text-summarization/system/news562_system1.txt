Kuwait may re-register part of its  tanker fleet with foreign flag jurisdictions, including the  U.S. And USSR, in an attempt to protect them from Iranian  missile attacks in the Gulf war zone, U.S. Officials were  quoted by the New York Times as saying.
Soviet flag tankers transporting Kuwaiti oil through the  Gulf may get Soviet escorts, the officials said.
Kuwait had earlier considered having both USSR and U.S.  Escorts, but the U.S. Was unwilling to give the Soviet Union a  naval role in the region, the newspaper quoted the officials as  saying.
The U.S. And Kuwait have been negotiating for over a month  on methods of protecting Kuwaiti ships.
