Fundamental Brokers Institutional  Associates, a leading inter-dealer broker in U.S. government  securities, said it has agreed to acquire certain assets of MKI  Government Brokers Inc for undisclosed terms.
In conjunction with the sale of assets, MKI has ceased  brokering treasury bills, notes and bonds, Fundamental said.
Industry sources told Reuters yesterday that Fundamental  was close to acquiring the government securities brokerage  division of MKI, a major broker of corporate bonds.
Fundamental said it intends to use the facilities formerly  used by MKI to provide a new block brokering service in the  most active Treasury issues.
"The new system is expected to substantially enhance the  liquidity and effiency of markets," Fundamental said.
