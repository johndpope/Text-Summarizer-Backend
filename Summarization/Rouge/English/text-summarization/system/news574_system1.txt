E.F. Hutton LBO Inc is still interested  in an acquisition of Purolator Courier Corp, and is examining  the possibility of raising its 35 dlr per share offer, an E.F.  Hutton spokesman said.
Analysts said it might be difficult for Hutton to raise the  offer since Emery, an overnight courier, might have an easier  time justifying a lofty price since it would realize cost  savings by combining its business with those of Purolator.
