&lt;Placer Pacific Ltd> said it will  undertake a full feasibility study of Western Australia's Big  Bell gold prospect.
Results of an economic evaluation of the find, in which  Placer has an option with &lt;Australian Consolidated Minerals  Ltd> (ACM) to earn a 50 pct interest, were encouraging enough  to warrant a full study, Placer said in a statement.
If the results are positive and a commitment to develop  made then construction would take about 12 months, Placer said.
