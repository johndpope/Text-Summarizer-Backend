A group led by Far Hills, N.J.,  investors Natalie and Paul Koether told the Securities and  Exchange Commission it has acquired 299,523 shares of American  Physicians Service Group Inc, or 5.1 pct of the total.
The group also said Paul Koether met on June 8 with  management representatives for talks that included the  company's business, potential acquisitions for the company,  possible opportunities to expand the company and the  possibility of Koether being named to its board.
While they may buy more American Physicians shares, the  Koethers also said they may decide to sell some or all of the  their stake in the company.
