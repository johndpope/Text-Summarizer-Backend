Danish-based insulin and enzymes  producer Novo Industri A/S (NVO.CO) said pre-tax earnings fell  almost 10 pct in 1986 though sales rose by two pct.
"Foreign exchange fluctuations in 1986 were a very  significant factor behind developments in the result before and  after tax," Novo said in a statement.
In November 1986, Novo purchased 75 pct of shares in A/S  Ferrosan, which heads a group specialising in research and  development of CNS (central nervous treatment) treatments and  the sale of pharmaceuticals and vitamins in Scandinavia.
The 357 mln crowns paid in goodwill "had a very limited  effect on the 1986 result," the Novo statement said.
