Japan denied breaking a pact with the  U.S. On semiconductor trade but said prices set out in the pact  were too high and acknowledged difficulties in implementing the  accord.
"We are faithfully abiding by the ... Agreement but of  course there are some problems," a spokesman for the  International Trade and Industry Ministry told Reuters.
The U.S. Senate Finance Committee this week called on  President Reagan in a non-binding resolution to retaliate  against Japan for violating the agreement.
