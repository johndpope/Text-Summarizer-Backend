Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. said it  will sign a contract March 17 to buy a half interest in a  Corpus Christi, Texas refinery and related operations.
The contract, to be signed by PDVSA and Champlin  Petroleum's parent company, the Union Pacific Corp &lt;UNP>, will  create a new joint venture called Champlin Refining.
PDVSA and Union Pacific have sought a line of credit from a  group of North American and Japanese banks to finance the new  company's working capital, the Venezuelan company said.
Under the deal, PDVSA will supply up to 140,000 barrels a  day to the refinery with the option to place 50,000 bpd more -  mostly gasoline and distillates - through Champlin's  distribution system in 10 U.S. states.
