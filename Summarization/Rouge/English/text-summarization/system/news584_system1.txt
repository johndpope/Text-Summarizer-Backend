The company said it filed in the Federal Court in the  Central District of California, charging the tender offer,  which its board rejected, violated federal securities laws and  federal margin regulations.
The suit also charges the offer is illusory and designed to  manipulate the market in Caesars World stock to enable Sosnoff  to sell the Caesars World stock he already owns for a  substantial profit.
The complaint seeks, among other things, to enjoin the  tender offer and to require MTS and Sosnoff to correct false  and misleading statements in the offer.
