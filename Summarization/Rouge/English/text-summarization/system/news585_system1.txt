Strong south-easterly winds were  keeping many vessels trapped in the ice off the Finnish and  Swedish coasts in one of the worst icy periods in the Baltic  for many years, the Finnish Board of Navigation said.
In Finland and Sweden up to 50 vessels were reported to be  stuck in the ice, and even the largest of the assisting  icebreakers were having difficulties in breaking through to the  stranded ships, coastguard officials said.
Weather officials in neighbouring Sweden said the icy  conditions in the Baltic were the worst for 30 years, with  ships fighting a losing battle to keep moving.
