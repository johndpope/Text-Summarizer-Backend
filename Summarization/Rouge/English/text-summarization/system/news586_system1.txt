A South African trade union is in  dispute with a subsidiary of Britain's Johnson Matthey Plc over  the company's proposal to move a platinum refinery near  Johannesburg to a black tribal homeland.
The 30,000-member mainly black Chemical Workers Industrial  Union said it fears the planned move to the Bophuthatswana  homeland, where South African unions are not recognised, could  lead to job losses and affect wages.
