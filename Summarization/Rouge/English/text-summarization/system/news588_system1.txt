The U.S. Treasury proposed allowing   temporary imports of South African uranium ore and uranium  oxide until July 1 under certain conditions pending  clarification of anti-apartheid laws passed by Congress last  fall.
The Treasury said it proposed allowing the temporary  imports because it felt Congress had not intended when it  passed the comprehensive South African sanctions bill last fall  -- overriding President Reagan's veto -- to hurt U.S. industry.
The South African sanctions law, enacted by the U.S. to  protest the apartheid laws of racial segregation practiced by  South Africa's white minority government, prohibited imports of  uranium ore and oxide, iron and steel, coal and textiles at the  end of 1986.
