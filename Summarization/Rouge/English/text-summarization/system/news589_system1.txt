"Two years ago, I began to seek my own farmland in Japan,"  said Isao Nakamura, president of Higashi Nippon.
"However, sale  of Japanese farmland is strictly controlled by the government,  so I began to look for the land in the U.S to make my dream to  own farm land come true."
Nakamura said hundreds of companies exist in the U.S. To  sell farmland to investors as more and more farmers face  difficulties due to the recession in U.S. Agriculture.
