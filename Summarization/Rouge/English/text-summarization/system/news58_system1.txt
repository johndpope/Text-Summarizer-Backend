Lebanon's Bankers Association said it  extended its suspension of trading in the Lebanese pound for  two more working days to study ways to stem the currency's  collapse.
The Central Bank did not post the rate of the pound to the  dollar and other currencies on Monday.
Association sources told Reuters Friday's suspension of  trading for two working days was continued on Monday for two  more days so as to study proposals to reinforce the pound.
The Association, which comprises 106 commercial banks in  east and west Beirut, halted trading on Friday in a chaotic  market after the pound crashed to four record lows in the week.
The pound, hit by the inability of Lebanon's religiously  and ideologically divided government to end 12 years of civil  war, has lost more than 80 pct of its international value this  year.
