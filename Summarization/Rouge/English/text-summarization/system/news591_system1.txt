The Quebec government said it joined  with B.F. Goodrich Canada Inc to study the feasability of  building a vinyl chloride monomer plant in Montreal.
The plant  would supply manufacturers of PVC construction and other  materials in Eastern Canada and the Northeastern U.S.,  government officials said.
more      The Quebec government has said it wants the project to  proceed because it would provide future demand for Petromont  Inc petrochemical products.
Quebec said it also wants Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd  &lt;IPIPF.O> to adapt its pipeline from Sarnia, Ont., to Montreal  to carry natural gas liquids, a decision that will be made by  the federal National Energy Board.
It said the pipeline could  provide Petromont with feedstock at one-third the cost of  moving it by rail.
