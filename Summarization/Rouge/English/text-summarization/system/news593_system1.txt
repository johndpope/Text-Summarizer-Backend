California Microwave Inc said  it will take non-recurring charges of 9.7 mln dlrs to pre-tax  earnings in the third quarter ended March 31.
The company said earnings from operations in the second  half, ending June 30, 1987, excluding the charges, are expected  to be in the break-even range.
California Microwave previously estimated the write-downs  in the six to eight-mln-dlr range.
It said it will add to that  a reserve for investment losses in Argo Communications Corp.      Also to be included in the write-down are charges against  its advances to an Arizona-based communications electronics  firm the company has an option to acquire, it said.
California Microwave said the write-downs should have a  nominal cash impact, as the company already has paid for the  assets being written down.
