Texas' cotton crop stands little  chance of damage from frigid temperatures expected tonight in  that state, as very little cotton has been planted, according  to Texas agricultural sources and cotton market analysts.
Only six pct  of the crop was planted as of last week," said Doug Stillmann,  a statistician at the Texas Agricultural Statistic Service in  Austin, a division of the U.S. Agriculture Department.
Stillmann and other cotton market sources said planting had  begun in the Rio Grande Valley and South Texas areas only, with  planting in the crucial high and low plains areas not slated to  begin until next month.
Temperatures tonight in most of Texas are expected to drop  to freezing to the low 20s, although the lower Rio Grande  Valley may see more moderate readings in the middle 30s,  according to meteorologists at Accu-Weather Inc.
The price of new-crop cotton on the New York cotton futures  market rallied today on weather-related fears.
