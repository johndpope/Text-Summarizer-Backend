Interest rates on the London money market  were slightly firmer on news U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer  Nigel Lawson had stated target rates for sterling against the  dollar and mark, dealers said.
Operators feel the foreign exchanges are likely to test  sterling on the downside and that this seems to make a fall in  U.K. Base lending rates even less likely in the near term,  dealers said.
The feeling remains in the market, however, that  fundamental factors have not really changed and that a rise in  U.K. Interest rates is not very likely.
