But attorneys for lawyer Thomas Ward, a member of the  Guinness board, told a court yesterday in the Channel Island of  Jersey that Ward saw the payment as his reward for services in  last year's 2.7 billion stg takeover.
Guinness says its former chairman Ernest Saunders and Ward  "breached their fiduciary duty" in authorising the payment to  Ward, via a Jersey-based company, Marketing and Acquisitions  Consultants and has gone to the Jersey court to recover it.
"The bid would not have been successful but for the ...  Services of Mr Ward," MAC attorneys said in the documents  submitted in court.
