Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita  said the central bank has no intention of cutting its discount  rate again as a way of preventing the yen's rise.
Although the yen's rise will have a greater deflationary  impact on the economy, the economy is not likely to slow down  much further, Sumita said.
Dealers said they expect the six - Britain, Canada, France,  Japan, the U.S. Amd West Germany - to meet just before the  IMF/World Bank interim committee meeting in Washington starting  on April 9.
