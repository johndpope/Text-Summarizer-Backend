Dutch consumers and food processors  would be hit hard by the proposed EC tax on oils and fats, Dick  de Bruyn, chairman of the commodity board for margarine, fats  and oils, MVO, said at the annual meeting.
The fiercely contested tax would be a levy on consumers and  steeply increase the costs of industries such as potato  processing and cake and biscuit manufacturing, de Bruyn said.
De Bruyn said the tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats  would be wide open to fraud, difficult to police, and hugely  expensive administratively.
