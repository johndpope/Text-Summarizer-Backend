The Unilever Plc and NV &lt;UN.A> group saw  improved performance in almost all sectors during 1986, the  Anglo-Dutch group said in its results statement.

The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the  accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the  net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at  January 1, 1987.
Unilever Plc shares are up 25p since yesterday at 2,575p in  buoyant response to the results and share split proposal,  though 1986 profits were not ahead of market forecasts, dealers  added.
