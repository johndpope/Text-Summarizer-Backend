The 37,635 deadweight tonnes bulk carrier  Cumberlande, which sank in the South Pacific last Friday, was  carrying a cargo which included lead as well as magnesium ore,  a Lloyds Shipping Intelligence spokesman said.
Trade reports circulating the London Metal Exchange said  the vessel, en route to New Orleans from Newcastle, New South  Wales, had been carrying 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates.
Trade sources said that 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates  could convert to around 5,000 tonnes of metal, although this  depended on the quality of the concentrates.
Supplies  there have been very tight this year and there is a strike at  one major producer, Cominco, and labour talks currently being  held at another, Noranda subsidiary Brunswick Mining and  Smelting Ltd.
