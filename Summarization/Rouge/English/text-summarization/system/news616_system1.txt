Manufacturers Hanover Corp said it  placed 1.4 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to  Brazilian borrowers on non-accrual as of yesterday, meaning  that income will be recorded only when actual cash payments are  received.
If Brazil, which suspended interest payments on its term  debt on February 20, continues to defer interest payments for  the rest of the year, net income for the whole of 1987 would be  reduced by a total of 72 mln dlrs.
