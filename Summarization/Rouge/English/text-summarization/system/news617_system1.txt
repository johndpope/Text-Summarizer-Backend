Irving Bank Corp said a six pct drop  in first-quarter net income from a year earlier was largely the  result of placing medium- and long-term loans to borrowers in  Brazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status.
Irving put 215 mln dlrs of Brazilian and 33 mln dlrs of  Ecuadorean loans on non-accrual, reducing first-quarter net  income by a total of 4.4 mln dlrs after tax.
Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mln  dlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received on  these loans during the remainder of 1987.
