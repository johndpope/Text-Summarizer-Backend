The board also said it will ask representatives of the  Committee to Restore Shareholder value to begin acquainting  themselves with the business and affairs of the company as  promptly as possible.
To that end, the committee's representatives will be  invited in advance of the annual meeting to examine the  company's financial records, to monitor its operations and to  join company officers in meetings with the company's suppliers,  bankers and key personnel, Crazy Eddie said.
The board said that to continue to oppose the EMI-Palmieri  group would only increase the expenses of the company, create  further uncertainty among its suppliers, customers and  employees, and result in deterioration of moral among company  personnel.
