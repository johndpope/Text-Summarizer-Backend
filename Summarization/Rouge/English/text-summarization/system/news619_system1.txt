Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul  Volcker said current data does not give a clear sign that the  deterioration in the U.S. trade balance has yet been reversed.
"The data we have in hand do not provide clearcut evidence  that the deterioration in the trade balance has yet been  reversed," Volcker said in remarks prepared for delivery to a  luncheon for community leaders here.
He said the process of restoring external balance to the  U.S. economy requires dealing with the budget deficit.
