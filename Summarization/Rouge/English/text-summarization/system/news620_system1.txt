Loans and advances from the Dutch  Central Bank to the commercial banks rose by 1.2 billion  guilders to 10.7 billion in the week up to and including April  6, the Bank's weekly return showed.
Paper discounted with the Bank also rose, by 477 mln  guilders to 916 mln.
These rises were balanced by a 1.6 billion guilders rise in  the Treasury's account at the Bank, made up mainly of  repayments on housing loans by local authorities.
The  Treasury's account stood at 8.1 billion guilders, the weekly  return showed.
They added that the rise in the reserves was merely the  result of commercial currency transactions by the Bank.
Call money and period tariffs were only fractionally  changed this week and were seen sustaining their stable levels  since no dramatic changes in the money market debt, currently  around 10.25 billion guilders, are expected.
