Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul  Volcker said both the Fed and the financial markets remain  concerned about the possibility of renewed inflation.
"A possibility of renewed inflation remains of concern,  both in the markets and within the Federal Reserve," he said in  remarks prepared for delivery to a group of business leaders  here.
He said one potential channel for renewed inflationary  pressures would be an excessive fall of the dollar in the  exchange markets, which would push import prices up sharply.
"Should the skepticism about our ability to resist  inflation be reinforced by bad policy, the consequences for  interest rates, for exchange rates, and for the economy  generally would clearly be undesirable...recognition of that  danger neccesarily must weigh heavily in the formation of  monetary policy," the Fed chairman said.
