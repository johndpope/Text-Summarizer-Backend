Shifts in domestic economic policy,  not a further fall in the dollar or trade restrictions, are the  key to reducing imbalances in trade and payments, Dutch Finance  Miniister H. Onno Ruding said.
"The main contribution towards resolving the still enourmous  U.S. trade deficit is not repeat not a further fall in the  dollar, is not still more protectionism in your country."
He said the highest priority should be given to policy  changes in the United States, especially reducing the budget  deficit and encouraging domestic savings.
