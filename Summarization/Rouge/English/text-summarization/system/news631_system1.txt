Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah  bin Abdul Aziz was thanked by the Reagan administration for his  country's close, and closed-mouthed, cooperation with  Washington in the Gulf, a senior U.S. official said.
It would be nice if  the Saudis would go more public, but it's their real estate,"  said the official who asked not to be named.
He declined to describe what sort of help the Saudis were  providing, saying that Saudi officials are reluctant to  acknowledge their role in the Gulf where the United States has  stationed forces to protect shipping lanes.
Asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the  attack, the prince, who is here on an official visit, replied,  "I believe what the United States has done is their  responsibility as a superpower."
