Malaysian Primary Industries  Minister Lim Keng Yaik welcomed the basic accord reached over  the weekend in Geneva between producers and consumers on a new  International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA).
"This is a good development and if a new pact is adopted  this week it will augur well for the rubber industry and prices  in the long term," he told Reuters here.
Negotiators at a United Nations conference on a new INRA  resolved differences and agreed last Saturday on basic elements  for a new pact to replace the current one, which expires in  October.
Conference Chairman Manaspas Xuto said legal drafting of  the new pact will begin this week and it is expected to be  formally adopted by some 40 countries on March 20.
