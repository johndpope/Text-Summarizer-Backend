Indonesia's coffee production in  1986/87 ending September 30 may fall slightly from last year's  level of 360,000 tonnes, Dharyono Kertosastro, chairman of the  Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters told Reuters.
Dharyono said production was behind a five year plan target  of 420,000 tonnes for the current year, but Indonesia is trying  to boost output through introduction of higher yielding seeds,  better training for farmers and increased use of fertilizers.
