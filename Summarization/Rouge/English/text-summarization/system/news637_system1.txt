Comalco Ltd said its return to profit  reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and  its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture.
It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the  year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was  also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and  greater sales of bauxite and aluminium.
