The cabinet approved a separate bill that analysts said  includes provisions to make more difficult the build-up of  major new stakes in Belgian companies.
The Minister for Economic Affairs would need to be informed  in advance of deals under which foreign interests planned to  buy a new stake of more than ten pct of the voting shares in a  large Belgian company, or to increase an existing stake to more  than 20 pct.
