A U.S. Commerce Department spokesman  said the agency would have no comment on Schlumberger Ltd's  announcement that it had terminated an agreement in principle  to sell its Fairchild Semiconductor Corp unit to Fujitsu Ltd.      Sclumberger had said that controversy surrounding the  venture made it unlikely the sale could be completed any time  soon.
Officials last week told Reuters that Commerce Secretary  Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger had  joined forces to fight the planned sale because it could have  left the U.S. military overly dependent on foreign sources for  vital equipment used in high-technology weapons.
