Mannesmann AG &lt;MMWG.F>, the  diversified engineering and pipe-making group, is interested in  taking a stake in a U.S. Company or companies but has not yet  found a suitable firm, a spokesman said in reply to questions.
Mannesmann managing board chairman Werner Dieter told the  business weekly Wirtschaftswoche in an interview that  Mannesmann wanted to invest in a U.S. Company in order to  strengthen its presence on the U.S. Market.
Dieter said Mannesmann would act quickly when and if it  found a firm in which it wanted to take a stake.
The Mannesmann spokesman declined to say in which  industrial sector the group may make a U.S. Acquisition or how  big the acquisition might be.
He also said the group had not yet completed taking over a  stake in car components firm &lt;Fichtel und Sachs AG>.
Mannesmann had said in January it hoped to take a 37.5 pct  stake in Fichtel und Sachs's holding company, Sachs AG, in the  first quarter.
