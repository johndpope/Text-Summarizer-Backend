The British Petroleum &lt;BP.L> Co Plc's  refinery at Grangemouth, Scotland, shut down after an explosion  and fire in the hydrocracker on March 22, will probably be back  in operation towards the week-end, a refinery spokesman said.
He said the refinery will resume at about half its 178,500  barrels per day (bpd) capacity, as work on overhauling the  North Side of the complex, which began at the end of January,  will not be completed before the end of April.
The explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed,  caused extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000  hydrocracker and the spokesman said today this unit would be  out of operation for several months.
In an earlier incident, two people were killed in an  explosion and fire at the refinery on March 13.
