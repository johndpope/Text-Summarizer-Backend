Iran has test-fired its newly acquired  Silkworm anti-shipping missile in the Strait of Hormuz and has  set up at least two land-based launching sites in the area, a  British naval source in the Gulf said.
The source, who declined to be identified, said Iran had  fired the Chinese-made missile at a hulk off its southern Gulf  naval port of Bandar Abbas and scored a hit.
Tension in the Gulf has risen since U.S. Officials last  week broke the news that Iran had acquired the Silkworm  missiles.
The British naval source said the Silkworms were in place  at at least two sites around the Strait of Hormuz, but would  not give the exact location.
