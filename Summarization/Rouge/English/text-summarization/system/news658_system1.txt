The Soviet Union supports the freedom  of navigation in the Gulf and does not support any act which  would cause the deterioration of the situation in the region,  its ambassador to Kuwait, Ernest Zverev, told the Kuwaiti news  agency KUNA.
"We support the freedom of navigation in the Arabian Gulf  and the Strait of Hormuz," the agency quoted Zverev as saying.
KUNA also said the envoy had discussed the deployment of  Iranian missiles near the Strait of Hormuz with Kuwaiti Foreign  Undersecretary Suliman Majed al-Shaheen.
The tests had been successful and the missiles could be  used against shipping in the strait, the source added.
