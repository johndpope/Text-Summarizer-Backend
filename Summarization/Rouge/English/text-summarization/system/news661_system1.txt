The U.S. Court of International Trade has  upheld the International Trade Commission's refusal to extend  countervailing duties on Canadian hogs to include pork  products, the National Pork Producers' Council said.
The court's ruling came in an appeal to the Trade  Commission's decision filed by the Pork Producers' Council.
Council president Tom Miller said he was disappointed by  the court ruling and said the council will accelerate  activities in support of an amendment to the 1930 Tariff Act  that would address the objections outlined in the Trade  Commission's ruling.
An appeal by the Canadian Pork Council that the current  countervailing duty on Canadian hogs entering the U.S. be  lifted is pending before the Court.
