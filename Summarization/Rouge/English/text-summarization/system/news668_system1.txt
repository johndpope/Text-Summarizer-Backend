GAF Corp said the management group  led by chairman Samuel J. Heyman intends to reconsider its  proposal to acquire GAF.
On September 8, the group offered 64.00 dlrs in cash and  2.50 dlrs principal amount of 15 pct junior subordinated  debentures due 2007 for each GAF share.
In a letter to the committee of independent directors  formed to consider the offer, Heyman said it will have to  modify the terms of the offer if it is to continue the bid, due  to rising interest rates and financial market conditions.
As of the present time, the  average interest rate on the financing which we proposed to  raise in connection with the acquisition has increased, since  the original proposal, by approximately 150 basis points."
He said the group intends to promptly review all available  options, including the revision of its offer to reflect current  market conditions.
