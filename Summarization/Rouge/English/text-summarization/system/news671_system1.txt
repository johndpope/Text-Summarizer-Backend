U.S. Trade Representative Clayton  Yeutter stressed the importance of trade negotiations to open  foreign markets rather than trade restrictions in a statement  to the Senate Finance Committee.
Yeutter said the trade bill should increase U.S.  competitiveness, aid U.S. trade negotiating leverage, and avoid  provoking foreign retaliation.
He urged Congress to reject provisions that would mandate  U.S. retaliation against foreign unfair trade practices.
Yeutter emphasized the importance of the new multilateral  trade negotiating round and called on Congress to quickly  approve an extension of U.S. negotiating authority.
