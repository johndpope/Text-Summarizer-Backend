Banking authorities and police are  investigating an alleged fraud by the second largest trading  house in the Caracas free foreign exchange market, Finance  Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters.
The Superintendency of Banks and the Technical and Judicial  Police have both begun probes of Cambio la Guiara, Azpurua said  on Friday night.
The Venezuelan central bank on June 17 suspended the  licences of all 21 foreign exchange operators in the parallel  market, blaming their speculation for the constant rise in the  value of the U.S. Dollar here.
Juan Domingo Cordero, vice-president of the Caracas Stock  Exchange and the owner of a foreign exchange trading house,  said on Friday he had begun legal action against Cambio la  Guiara for issuing him four checks without funds for a total  amount of almost one mln dlrs.
