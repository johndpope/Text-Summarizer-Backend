U.S. personal income rose 0.2 pct, or  7.9 billion dlrs, in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate  of 3,630.0 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said.
Personal consumption expenditures rose 0.1 pct, or 1.5  billion dlrs, to 2,893.3 billion dlrs in May after rising 0.6  pct or 18.6 billion dlrs in April, the department said.
The department said both the April and May increases in  personal income were restrained by lower subsidy payments to  farmers and by initial payments to a newly established  retirement fund for federal government employees in April.
