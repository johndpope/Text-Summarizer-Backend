Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW),  Victoria and Western Australia yesterday lifted their ban on  foreign-flag ships carrying containers but NSW ports are still  being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.
The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented  the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.
Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the  ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.
The shipping sources said the various port unions appear to  be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of  each shift and then to walk off.
