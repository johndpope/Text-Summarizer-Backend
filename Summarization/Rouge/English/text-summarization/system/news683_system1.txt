House Ways and Means Committee  Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation  to pass a protectionist trade bill this year.
In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press  Club, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislation  will be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year.
But he warned that his "conciliatory message" on the trade  bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn  other countries their access to the American market would be  curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods.
"It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied  us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the  American market," he added.
