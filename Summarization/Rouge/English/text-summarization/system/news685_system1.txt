Upcoming changes being considered in  the U.S. Agriculture Department's transportation and loan  programs were outlined by a USDA official today.
Addressing the annual meeting of the National Grain and  Feed Association, Tom VonGarlem, assistant deputy administrator  for USDA's state and county operations, said the following  changes are under consideration by USDA.
While the department has not  made any final decision, banning the use of pik and roll grain  in reserve rotation is under heavy consideration, he said.
Changes in loan rates will definitely be looked at for next  year's crop, he said, with the option of making soybean loans  partially in cash and in certificates under consideration.
