Britain's highest court has decided the  International Tin Council (ITC) can appeal over the use of ITC  documents in court actions.
Lawyers working in the legal tangle left  from the October 1985 collapse of the tin market said this  hearing is likely to last a few days.
The House of Lords ruling on the use of ITC documents will  be referred back to the action by two Shearson Lehman companies  against the London Metal Exchange although the underlying case  is not expected to be resumed until mid-1988.
The Court of Appeal hearings include action between brokers  and cases by brokers and banks against the ITC and the member  governments of the tin council.
Action taken by brokers seeking both the winding up of the  ITC or and placing it into receivership will also be covered by  the Court of Appeal legal schedule.
