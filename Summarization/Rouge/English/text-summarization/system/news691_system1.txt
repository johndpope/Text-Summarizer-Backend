Canada will propose at the new round of  international trade talks that most trade-distorting farm  subsidies be phased out over a five year period, Trade Minister  Pat Carney said.
Carney was outlining the government's new position on the  farm trade problem that was tabled on Tuesday in Geneva in the  multilateral talks under the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade).
While few details were released, Carney said the government  would also be pressing for an improvement in market access and  new measures to ensure countries do not erect artificial  barriers.
"Under the Canadian proposal, all countries would have to  ensure that domestic policies and programs to address the  specific needs of their farm sectors do not distort trade," a  government background paper said.
