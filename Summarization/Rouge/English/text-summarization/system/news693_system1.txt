A Swedish Finance Ministry committee  forecast that British Petroleum Plc &lt;BP.L> may have to close  its refinery in Gothenburg because of an anticipated worsening  of the Swedish petroleum industry's competitiveness.
It said in a report that the future of the Swedish refining  business was bleak due to the steady drop in domestic oil  consumption since the mid-1970s, a possible tightening of rules  on sulphur content and competition from Norway's Mongstad  facility of &lt;Den Norske Stats Olieselskab> (Statoil) &lt;STAT.OL>  when its expansion is completed in the 1990s.
