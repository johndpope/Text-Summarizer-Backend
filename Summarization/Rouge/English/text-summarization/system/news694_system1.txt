Hecla Mining Co said it  has agreed to purchase a 28 pct interest in the Greens Creek  Joint Venture from British Petroleum Co PLC's Amselco Minerals  Inc unit.
It said there is  significant potential for the discovery of additional ore.      Hecla said initial production from a trackless underground  mine is scheduled for late 1988 at a rate of about 1,000 tons  or ore per day.
"At this rate, the Greens Creek mine will be  the largest domestic silver mine and is expected to be one of  the lowest cost producers."
The company said it estimates its total investment in the  project, including its share of preproduction costs, at about  45 mln dlrs, to be funded through internally generated cash and  existing lines of credit.
