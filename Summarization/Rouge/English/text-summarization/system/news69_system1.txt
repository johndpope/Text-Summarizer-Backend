Warrington said it plans to concentrate on its Canstar  Sports Group Inc skate and athletic footwear division, the  largest ice skate manufacturer and distributor in the Western  world.
Warrington said it decided to rationalize the balance of  its ski businesses, which is expected to result in a divestment  loss which could outweigh the net gains on the sales of its  shoe and ski boot divisions.
Taurus said the acquisition is expected to increase its  annual sales to about 100 mln dlrs and make it Canada's largest  footwear manufacturer.
