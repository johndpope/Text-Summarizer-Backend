Citicorp expects net income in its  individual banking sector to top one billion dlrs by 1993,  compared with 462 mln dlrs in 1986, said Richard Braddock, head  of Citicorp's individual banking division.
He said that bank card operations and the New York branch  system would continue to turn in hefty profits but also picked  out other developing areas, such as U.S. mortgage and  international consumer, as major potential earners.
Braddock and his sector heads made the following more  specific predictions:      - Cost of funds and net credit loss levels in the U.S.  bankcard unit will taper off in coming years from 1986's  relatively inflated levels.
- Customer net revenue in the mortgage banking area will  rise to 464.7 mln dlrs in 1987 from 374.3 mln in 1986.
