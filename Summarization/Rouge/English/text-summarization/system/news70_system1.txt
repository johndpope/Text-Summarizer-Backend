Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corp  Ltd said it expects 1987 earnings will be lower than last  year's previously reported 85 cts a share.
Highveld said measures taken last year by the European  Economic Community and the United States prohibiting all South  African steel products "presents a challenge to management to  place the steel in other areas."
The company said overall world vanadium consumption in 1987  is expected to be similar to last year although China's role is  still an unknown factor in the total supply-demand situation.
