CIP Inc, wholly-owned by Canadian  Pacific Ltd, is considering building a pulp mill in Texas which  would use kenaf fibre instead of wood, CIP president Cecil  Slenniken said in an interview.
The plant, which has  been grown in Southern Texas, reaches a height of 10 feet in  three months and is said to produce better quality newsprint  than wood pulp, a CIP official said.
Slenniken said the company has commissioned studies for a  200,000 tonne capacity pulp mill which would use the fibre but  would need partners to begin the project.
He said CIP has been using the pulp on a trial basis to  make newsprint containing 90 pct kenaf fibre and 10 pct  softwood fibre at its Trois-Rivieres, Quebec plant.
