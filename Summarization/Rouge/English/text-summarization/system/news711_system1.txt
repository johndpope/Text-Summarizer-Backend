French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur  issued a firm call for the continued faithful application of  the Louvre accords on currency stability by all major  industrial countries.
Balladur, responding to weekend remarks by U.S. Treasury  Secretary James Baker that the U.S. Would take another look at  the accords, said "I firmly desire a faithfull and firm  adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre  accords -- in both their letter and spirit."
On Sunday, Baker said last week's rise in short-term West  German interest rates was not in keeping with the accords.
