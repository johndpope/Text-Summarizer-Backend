Senate Banking Committee chairman  William Proxmire called for curbs of hostile corporate  takeovers and new restrictions on risk arbitrageurs.
"A burning issue must be whether there ought to be a  complete seperation in the future of risk arbitrage and  investment banking," Proxmire said.
"I believe that takeovers have  become so abusive and so tilted in favor of the financial  buccaneers that remedial action is required," USX Corp chairman  David Roderick said.
