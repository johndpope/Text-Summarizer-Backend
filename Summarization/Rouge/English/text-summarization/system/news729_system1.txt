The United States wants Taiwan's  currency to appreciate faster to reduce Taiwan's trade surplus  with the U.S., A senior trade official said.
Board of Foreign Trade director Vincent Siew told reporters  on Saturday U.S. Officials told him in Washington last week  that unless Taiwan allowed its dollar to rise faster it would  face retaliation.
Siew returned from Washington on Friday after the U.S  responded to Taiwan's request to increase its textile export  quotas by promising further talks in May.
Western trade sources told Reuters Taiwan and the U.S. Have  been holding talks on the currency issue but added it is not  clear how far Washington wants to see the Taiwan dollar rise.
