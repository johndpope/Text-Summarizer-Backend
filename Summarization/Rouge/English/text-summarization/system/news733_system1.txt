U.K. Defence secretary George Younger is  expected to announce the government's decision on the sale of  state-owned arms manufacturer &lt;Royal Ordnance> today,  parliamentary sources said.
The bidders for the company were British Aerospace Plc  &lt;BAEL.L> and engineering group GKN Plc &lt;GKN.L>.
Defence electronics manufacturer Ferranti Plc &lt;FNTI.L> and  shipping and property group Trafalgar House Plc &lt;THSL.L> both  pulled out of the bidding shortly before last month's deadline.
Royal Ordnance made pre-tax profits of 26 mln stg on sales  of 487 mln stg in calendar 1985, its first full year of  commercial operation.
Other state-held companies earmarked for privatisation this  year include engine maker &lt;Rolls Royce Plc> and the &lt;British  Airports Authorities Plc>.
