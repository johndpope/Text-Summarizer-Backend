The Tanzanian government, in its  second annual budget since embarking on an economic recovery  program inspired by the International Monetary Fund, announced  increases in fuel prices and sales tax and higher levies on  government services.
Finance Minister Cleopa Msuya said the government expected  to spend 77.33 billion shillings in the financial year 1987/8,  39 pct more than this year's estimate.
This year's budget initially projected a deficit of only  3.35 billion shillings but in mid-year the government had to  impose new taxes to keep the deficit roughly on target.
