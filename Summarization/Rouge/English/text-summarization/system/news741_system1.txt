The state-owned Krung Thai Bank Ltd  will start taking over state-owned Sayam Bank Ltd and complete  the process in a year, Finance Minister Suthee Singhasaneh told  a press conference.
The minister said some of the existing 30 Sayam Bank  branches will be merged with their Krung Thai counterparts,  while others will continue operating but under Krung Thai's  name.
At  the end of 1985 the bank, with 13.8 billion baht of assets, was  ranked 12th among Thailand's 16 local commercial banks.
