Secretary of Commerce Malcolm  Baldrige expressed concern about the continuing U.S. trade  deficits with South Korea and Taiwan and said that without an  adjustment in exchange rates there is little likelihood of  improvement.
Speaking to the President's Export Council, an industry  advisory group, Baldrige said the trade deficit issue was under  discussion with those countries.
"I feel that unless we see an exchange rate adjustment we  probably won't be able to see much of a change in the large  surplus that Taiwan in particular has with us," he said.
