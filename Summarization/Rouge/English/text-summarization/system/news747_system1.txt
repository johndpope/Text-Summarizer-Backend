Paul Volcker's decision not to go for a  third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination of  Alan Greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns about  the U.S.' ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stem  rising inflation, financial market analysts said.
Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflation  fighter in the Volcker mould, doubts are already surfacing in  the U.S. financial markets as to whether he has enough  political clout and monetary experience to wage a tough  campaign against inflation over the next year or two.
"The critical issue is how (Greenspan) will deal with  inflation," said Stephen Axilrod, Vice Chairman of Nikko  Securities Co International Inc and former staff director for  monetary and financial policy at the Fed.
Until Greenspan answers them, the markets will  remain nervous," added Stephen Slifer, money market economist  at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.
