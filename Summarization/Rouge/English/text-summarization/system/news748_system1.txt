Ames Department Stores Inc fell 1-7/8  to 23 in what analysts said was a reaction to a surprise  announcement earlier today by the company that earnings in the  fiscal year ended January 31 will decline sharply.
Ames said it expects to report earnings of between 72 and  77 cts per share compared with 1.19 dlrs per share in the  previous year.
Ames said most  of the decline resulted from an inventory shortage at its  Secaucus, N.J. distribution center.
He declined to quantify the inventory shortage but said it  was the major reason for the decline in earnings.
