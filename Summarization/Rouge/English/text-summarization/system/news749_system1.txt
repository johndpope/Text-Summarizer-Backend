French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac  said that on financial issues, the United States and France had  "very close" views, and he said Treasury Secretary James Baker  was determined to support the February 22 Paris agreement on  stabilizing foreign exchange parities.
He described the dollar's sharp fall against the yen at the  start of the week as a "passing incident" and added, "Everyone is  resolved to support the Paris accord."
Chirac said he wanted commercial banks to give third world  countries better terms in rescheduling their debts, and for the  International Monetary Fund to soften its conditions.
