Thai sugar production totalled 960,788  tonnes in January, an increase of 12.7 pct on January 1986,  according to figures received by the International Sugar  Organization.
Production in the November 1986 to January 1987 period totalled  1.29 mln tonnes.
Domestic consumption increased 7.3 pct to 192,069 tonnes  for the three month period, but this was not sufficient to  prevent a significant rise in stocks, which climbed to 1.62 mln  tonnes by the end of January, compared with 1.52 mln a year  earlier.
