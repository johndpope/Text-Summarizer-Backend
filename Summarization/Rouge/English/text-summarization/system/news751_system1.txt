Japan could avoid a sharp rise in the  value of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. And  other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, an  advisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency  (EPA) said.
It said such a change  would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually  during the seven-year period to 1993.
If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar  would remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan's  current-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993.
It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy  and four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made.
