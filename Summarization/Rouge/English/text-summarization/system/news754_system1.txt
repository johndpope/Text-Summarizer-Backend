A meeting of eight Latin American  coffee producers ended with a call for continued talks aimed at  arriving at an agreement to stabilize international prices.
A statement delivered by the conference's president,  Nicaragua's External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca,  said the object of future meetings would be to seek  negotiations leading to basic export quotas.
Representatives at the meeting said efforts would continue  to be made to reach a regional consensus on export quotas which  could be presented to the International Coffee Organization.
