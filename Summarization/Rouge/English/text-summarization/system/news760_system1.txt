Italy's &lt;Gruppo Ferruzzi> is in the  advanced stages of negotiations that could result in an  acquisition worth "some hundreds of billions of lire" in the  European agro-industrial sector, a company spokesman told  Reuters.
The spokesman declined to identify the other party or  parties involved in talks, or whether a complete takeover was  under discussion, but said an Italian newspaper report that  Ferruzzi was studying the possibility of advancing an offer for  13 European cereal processing plants owned by the U.S. Group  CPC International Inc &lt;CPC.N> was incorrect.
The spokesman said that since the U.K. Government last  month blocked Ferruzzi's bid to acquire &lt;British Sugar Plc>,  the company had been looking at other investment opportunities.
