Dutch sugar traders deny involvement  in a plan to offer more than 850,000 tonnes of sugar to  intervention in protest at EC export policy and prices, traders  told Reuters.
Although some 2,500 tonnes of sugar have been offered to  intervention in the Netherlands, Dutch producers and traders  said this sugar was actually Belgian and was being offered by  the Belgian industry.
"We sympathise with the actions of the French, West German  and Belgian traders and producers, but we are not party to it,"  a spokesman said.
EC Commission sources said yesterday French traders planned  to sell 775,000 tonnes into intervention stocks, West German  traders 75,000 tonnes and Dutch traders 2,500.
