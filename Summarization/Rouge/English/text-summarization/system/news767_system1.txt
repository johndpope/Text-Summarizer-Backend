RepublicBank Corp said it has placed  182.6 mln dlrs of all intermediate and term loans to Brazil on  a non-accrual basis as of March 31.
It said the reclassification will reduce first quarter  earnings by 2.8 mln dlrs after taxes, and 11 mln dlrs after  taxes for all of 1987, if Brazil does not change its position  of a moratorium on interest payments.
The company also said its first quarter results are  expected to include a provision for loan losses of 55 mln dlrs,  about 20 mln dlrs over net loan-charge-offs of about 35 mln  dlrs.
