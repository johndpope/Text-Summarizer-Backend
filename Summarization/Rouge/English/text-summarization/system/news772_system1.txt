New Zealand has imposed sanctions  against Fiji in response to that country's change of status to  a republic, acting prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said.
"We won't be reacting further until these discussions with  the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister have been held,"  Palmer said.
Palmer said the cabinet was happy with the statement from  Commonwealth leaders in Vancouver that Fiji's membership of the  Commonwealth had lapsed.
