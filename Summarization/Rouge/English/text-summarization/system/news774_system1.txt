Dart Group Corp &lt;DARTA>, which wants  to acquire Supermarkets General Corp for 1.62 billion dlrs, is  not likely to give up without a fight if its target seeks  another buyer, arbitrageurs said.
One rumor had Federated Department Stores Inc &lt;FDS> taking  a look at Supermarkets General.
If history repeats itself, the Hafts could raise their bid  to 46 dlrs if they are rebuffed by Supermarkets General, the  arbitrageur said.
