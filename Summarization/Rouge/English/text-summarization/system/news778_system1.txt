Bankers Trust New York Corp said it has  placed its approximately 540 mln dlrs of medium- and long-term  loans to Brazil on non-accrual status and that first-quarter  net income will be reduced by about seven mln dlrs as a result.
The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when central  bank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a  90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that  matures on April 15.
