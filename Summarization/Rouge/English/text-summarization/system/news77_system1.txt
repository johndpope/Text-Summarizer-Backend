Botswana has stopped importing almost  all meat products from Zimbabwe after reports of a suspected  outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the neighbouring country.
Botswana's official news agency, BOPA, announcing the ban  last night, quoted Agriculture Minister Daniel Kwelagobe as  saying only sterilised and canned animal products would be  allowed into the country, with immediate effect.
He said Zimbabwean veterinary officials had notified him  that they suspected foot and mouth disease had broken out at  Insiza, 100 km northeast of Bulawayo, capital of the mainly  cattle-ranching southwestern province of Matabeleland.
The ban will affect products such as uncanned meat, milk,  ham, butter and bacon, BOPA reported.
