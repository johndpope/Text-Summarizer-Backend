Dutch Social Affairs Minister Louw de  Graaf announced he is withdrawing the annual 10 mln guilder  labour subsidy for Rotterdam's strike-hit general cargo sector  as from July 1.
The chairman of the port employers' organization, SVZ,  Jacques Schoufour, said he was unhappy with the decision and  added there was now no alternative to proceeding with  redundancy plans.
The series of strikes in the sector started on January 19  in protest at employers' plans to make 800 redundancies from  the 4,000-strong workforce by 1990 starting with 350 this year.
The FNV said the actual losses were nearer 17 to 20 mln and  said the employers had inflated the figures as part of their  plan to restructure completely the port's general cargo sector.
