The stock of McDonald's Corp rose  sharply this morning after analyst Daniel Lee of Drexel Burnham  Lambert Inc reiterated his recommendation of the stock, traders  said.
"Comparable store sales are up 5.6 pct in 1986 vs 1985,"  Lee said, "and the stock is trading below the market multiple."
He said "not many companies have a consistent 15 pct annual  earnings growth rate, return on equity above 20 pct, but trade  at less than the market multiple."
Analyst Lee said "the introduction of a new line of salads  this spring, at about the time we are all trying to squeeze  into bathing suits, should boost sales."
That compares with 1.1 mln dlrs a  year for the average Burger King and 800,000 dlrs a year for  the average Wendy's."
Since it cost about the same to build a  single store for any one of these chains, he said, "McDonald's  can well justify their expansion."
