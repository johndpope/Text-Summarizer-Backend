The Dutch current account surplus fell  5.4 billion guilders last year to a provisional 12.1 billion  guilders, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.
While the energy trade balance surplus rose by 5.4 billion  guilders, 4.7 billion of this gain was caused by temporary  improvements of terms of exchange and was aided by the delay  between the fall in oil and gas prices.
The current account showed a 5.2 billion guilder deficit on  invisibles, compared with a balance in 1985, the Finance  Ministry said, noting the surplus on transport services was  reduced substantially due to the lower dollar and oil price  falls.
