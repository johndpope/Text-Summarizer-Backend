Time Inc said the acquisition of Scott,  Foresman and Co last year will dilute earnings per share by  about 17 cts a share for the full year in 1987.
For the first quarter the acquisition will have a negative  impact of about 20 cts per share, chief financial officer  Thayer Bigelow told security analysts.
He said Scott, Foresman, a textbook publisher, will  contribute more than 50 mln dlrs in operating income before  depreciation and amortization for the full year.
Bigelow said the textbook business, which normally has its  highest profit in the third quarter and incurs a loss in the  first quarter, will have an "adverse impact of 15 mln dlrs' on  book publishing income for the first quarter.
