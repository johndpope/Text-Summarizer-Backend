Member states of the European  Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which  they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open  its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.
Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC  countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the  willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese  government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.
Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to  an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could  raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.
The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations  entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed  to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of  the U.S.
The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's  trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in  March, up from 1.94 billion in February.
