Britain's gold and currency reserves  showed an underlying rise of 1.785 billion dlrs in March after  a 287 mln dlr rise in January, the Treasury said.
The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England  operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of  borrowings and repayments.
Actual reserves rose by 1.89 billion dlrs, after rising 305  mln in February, to 22.26 billion.
Total reserves were revalued  to 27.04 billion dlrs, but would have totalled 24.15 billion  under the previous valuation, the Treasury said.
Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were  361 mln dlrs last month, after 36 mln in February.
