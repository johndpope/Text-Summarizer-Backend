Former Prime Minister Robert  Muldoon, an outspoken advocate of a managed float for the N.Z.
Dollar, said the currency is at least 10 pct overvalued.
Muldoon said in a speech last night the exchange rate  should be around 48 U.S.
Muldoon has no rank in the opposition National Party, and  party leaders, with an eye to general elections to be held by  September, have rejected his calls for a managed float.
He said the dollar was high because of "grossly excessive"  interest rates for government stock.
