Societe Generale, one of the three largest state-owned  banking groups, said in a statement that its parent company  profit for 1986 totalled 800 mln francs, up 21.2 pct on 1985's  660 mln profit.
The increase in the bank's gross operating profits was  mostly due to a rise in french franc deposits and personal  loans as well as the development of its financial activities,  Societe Generale said.
Parent company net banking earnings last year were also up  at 13.9 billion francs compared with 13.57 billion in 1985  while operating costs totalled 7.44 billion francs against 6.67  billion the previous year.
Societe Generale President Marc Vienot said in December he  expected group 1986 consolidated profits to rise to between 2.5  billion and 2.6 billion francs from 1.62 billion in 1985.
