Arvin Industries Inc said higher  interest costs from borrowings to make acquisitions will  produce earnings flat with last year's 59 cts a share results.
These results also reflect the seasonally low sales pattern  of automotive replacement parts in that period.
Chairman James Baker said 1987 quarterly comparisons will  not conform to historical patterns for the year because the  acquisitions of Schrader and Maremond occurred in different  quarters.
