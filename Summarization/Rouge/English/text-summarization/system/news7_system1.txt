French reserves fell in the week ended  March 19 following repayment of the bulk of the debt contracted  during January with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund, the  Bank of France said in its weekly statement.
The repayment of capital and interest on this loan, taken  out during the strong pressure on the franc which preceded the  European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and the subsequent  Group of Five meeting in Paris, took place on March 13.
It comprised the repayment of 11.25 billion francs' worth  of European Currency Units (ECUs), 9.72 billion francs' worth  of foreign currency and 1.72 billion francs' worth of special  drawing rights (SDRs), the Bank said.
