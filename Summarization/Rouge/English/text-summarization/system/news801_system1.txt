"We have left the door open and GE is reassessing the  merger and so are we," Westinghouse chairman Douglas Danforth  told Reuters at the conclusion of a meeting before analysts.
Danforth said he continues to see value in a merger between  Westinghouse's radio operation and those of NBC.
Discussions with NBC on the merger of the two companies'  radio units were suspended in December.
Danforth reaffirmed that Westinghouse is interested in  acquisitions, saying the company is leaning toward acquisitions  in the 300 mln to 500 mln dlr range.
