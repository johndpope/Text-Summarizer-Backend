Continuous rebel raids against oil  pipelines and foreign exploration camps endanger Colombia's  present oil bonanza, Franciso Chona, manager of the state-run  oil company Ecopetrol said.
He was speaking after a meeting with Defense Minister  Rafael Samudio, military chiefs and Mines and Energy Minister  Guillermo Perry to review the security situation in the light  of a recent upsurge of leftist guerrilla attacks in the  oil-rich Arauca region, bordering Venezuela.
Samudio stressed that, despite the most  recent attacks, which cost more than four mln dlrs in damage,  the overall situation had improved compared with last December  when initial measures were taken to combat a wave of attacks.
