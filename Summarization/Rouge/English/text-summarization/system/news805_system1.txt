Taiwan said its foreign reserves suffered  about 3.4 billion U.S. Dlrs in exchange rate losses from July  1986 to February 1987 as a result of the rise of the Taiwan  dollar against the U.S. Currency.
Yu Chien-ming, head of the government statistics  department, told parliament yesterday he expected the losses to  increase as the Taiwan dollar continues to strengthen.
