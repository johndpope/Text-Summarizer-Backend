Ecuador will produce crude oil in excess  of its 221,000-bpd OPEC quota during the second half of this  year, Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a news  conference.
Ecuador plans to produce 280,000 bpd in August, rising to  320,000 bpd next January, the minister said.
"We will be producing more than the quota to pay off the  crude and products we have been lent by Venezuela, Nigeria and  Kuwait and to compensate for the crude we have been unable to  produce during the past few months," he said.
While its production was down, Venezuela, Nigeria and  Kuwait loaned Ecuador a total 12 mln barrels of crude and four  mln barrels of products, Santos said.
