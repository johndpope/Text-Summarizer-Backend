Algerian and Spanish producers which  together meet 40 pct of the Western market's needs in  quicksilver have agreed to apply a minimum selling price of 300  dlrs per unit, the Algerian news agency APS said.
The two firms "took note with regret that prices quoted by  some specialised publications do not reflect the reality of the  whole market since they take into account only part of the  deals made," a statement by ENOF said.
