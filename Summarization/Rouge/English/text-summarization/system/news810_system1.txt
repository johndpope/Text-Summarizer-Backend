Ecuador will ask OPEC to raise its oil  export quota by 100,000 barrels per day to 310,000 to  compensate for lost output due to last week's earthquake,  deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite said.
Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo  Hernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified  part of Ecuador's export commitments.
Ecuador may be unable to export oil for up to five months  due to extensive damage to a 25 mile stretch of pipeline  linking jungle oilfields to the Pacific port of Balao.
