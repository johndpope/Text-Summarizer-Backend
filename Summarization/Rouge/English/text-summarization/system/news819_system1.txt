Economics Minister Martin Bangemann said  the state could not continue to pour money into West Germany's  ailing steel and coal industries because the subsidies  endangered other parts of the economy.
"We are subsidising the production of mineral coal and steel  to an enormous extent and at the same time putting a huge  burden on all other branches of industry and making them  uncompetitive," he said.
