The Reagan administration continues  to debate whether to offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet  Union, but would need assurances from the Soviets that they  would buy the wheat before the subsidy offer would be made, a  senior U.S. Agriculture Department official said.
"I think it still is under active debate whether or not it  would be advisable" to make an the export enhancement offer to  the Soviets, Thomas Kay, administrator of the department's  Foreign Agriculture Service, told Reuters.
Kay called reports that such an offer was imminent "premature."
