European Community (EC) industry  ministers agreed on a plan for voluntary steel plant closures,  drawn up by industry lobby group Eurofer, and calculated to  lead to the loss of about 22,000 jobs.
The ministers resolved that the proposed closures, which  should bring production capacity more in line with weak demand,  "remain considerably below the surplus in capacity."
They asked the EC Executive Commission to consult with  Eurofer, major steel companies and with governments, to  pinpoint scope for further capacity reductions beyond the  annual 15.26 mln tonnes identified by Eurofer.
Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministers  capacity was 30 mln tonnes in excess of requirements and that  this excess ought to be eliminated by the end of 1990.
