Varity Corp, earlier reporting a full  year loss against a prior year profit, said improvement is  expected in the balance of fiscal 1987 as new products fill the  inventory pipeline, cutbacks in operating costs are realized  and its newly acquired Dayton Walther business is fully  integrated.
However, operating results are likely to remain under  pressure in the first quarter ending April 30, it said.
Industry demand for farm machinery continued to erode  during the latest fiscal year, with worldwide industry retail  sales of tractors sliding more than 10 pct below last year's  depressed levels, the company said.
