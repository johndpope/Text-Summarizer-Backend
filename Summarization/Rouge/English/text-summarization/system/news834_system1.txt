World stocks of silver are large  enough to accommodate any changes in the supply-demand equation  this year, with industrial consumption expected to again exceed  mine production, the dealer house Handy and Harman said in its  annual review of the silver market.
The house estimated that the industry last year withdrew  20,000,000 ounces of silver from stocks to bridge a supply  deficit caused by a consumption rate of 403,000,000 ounces and  production level of 382,000,000 ounces.
Handy and Harman said 22,800,000 ounces of silver were used  to produce coins last year, up from 12,700,000 ounces in 1985,  with the demand getting a big boost from the production of U.S.  coins, including the American Eagle.
It also said that in recent years Communist countries have  increased their silver imports and estimated that China and  East Germany alone took in 70,000,000 ounces of foreign silver  in the last five years.
