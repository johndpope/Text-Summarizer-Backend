Endotronics Inc said it is the  target of a formal private investigation by the Securities and  Exchange Commission as well as the Federal Bureau of  Investigation.
Endotronics said the notice from its accountants stated   "we cannot satisfy ourselves as to the true facts of the  situation to a degree necessary to continue to be associated  with such consolidated financial statements."
Endotronics recently reported that it was reviewing the  need to establish a reserve for all or a portion of  approximately 3,686,000 dlrs in overdue accounts receivable and  to assess the impact, if any, on prior period financial  statements in light of a dispute with one of its Japanese  distributors over payment of the overdue accounts.
