Claremont Group Ltd, a New York  investment banking firm, said it intends to boost its current  10 pct stake in Champion Products Inc to as much as 15 pct of  the total outstanding common stock.
Claremont previously disclosed in December that it had  agreed to act in concert with Walsh, Greenwood and Co, an  affiliated investment firm, to acquire Champion Products.
In a March 20 letter to Champion Chairman John Tanis,  Claremont and Walsh representatives Stephen Walsh and John  Cirigliano said they were pleased with the company's  performance but wanted to take an active management role.
