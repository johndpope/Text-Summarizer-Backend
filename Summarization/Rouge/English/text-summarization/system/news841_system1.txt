Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>,  VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986  dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per  ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of  a suspected foreign currency fraud.
The figure is virtually  the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit.
When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it  said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark  dividend to the supervisory board.
