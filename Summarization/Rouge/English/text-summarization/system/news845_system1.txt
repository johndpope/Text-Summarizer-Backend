Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said he  expects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000,  probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars.
Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through  the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells  because of low prices was probably permanent.
"The area could contain potentially recoverable oil  resources of more than 9.2 billion barrels, an amount nearly  equal to the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which currently provides  almost one-fifth of U.S. domestic production," Hodel said.
He said production from the new section could begin about  the time Prudhoe Bay production begins to decline in 2000  without endangering caribou or other wildlife in the area.
