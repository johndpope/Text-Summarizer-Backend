Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige  has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned  Japanese acquisition of a major U.S. Computer and semiconductor  maker, U.S. Officials said yesterday.
The officials told reporters Baldrige had serious concerns  on national security grounds about the sale of Schlumberger Ltd  &lt;SLB> unit &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Inc> to Fujitsu Ltd  &lt;ITSU.T>.
The officials said the sale could leave the United  States overly dependent on a foreign company for equipment used  in advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligence  gathering.
The U.S. Officials added the sale would also worsen the  strained relations between the two countries stemming from the  huge Japanese trade surplus.
