French maize producers will ask the EC  Commission to grant permanent maize export rebates following  the recent EC/U.S.
Accord guaranteeing the U.S. An annual  export quota of two mln tonnes of maize for Spain over four  years, the French maize producers association, AGPM, said.
The request will be made when export certificates have been  granted for all the 500,000 tonnes, the AGPM said.
The association said that the request would cover exports  to all destinations, adding that the Soviet Union, which has  important maize needs, is currently excluded from the list of  destination countries for the 500,000 tonnes of French maize.
