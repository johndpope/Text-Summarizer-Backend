Italy's gross domestic product (GDP) will  grow three pct in real terms this year and 2.7 pct in 1988,  said economic information company Data Resources Europe Inc  (DRI).
Girardin said the driving force behind GDP growth next year  will shift from domestic demand to exports as a result of  expected depreciation of the lira against the major currencies.
Italy's budget ministry said yesterday that GDP rose 2.7  pct in real terms in 1986.
Girardin said the lira is expected to appreciate 14 pct  against the dollar this year following last year's 22 pct  appreciation.
