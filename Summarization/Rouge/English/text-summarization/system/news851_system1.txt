Venezuela has still to work out final  details of its plan to supply Ecuador with 50,000 barrels per  day of crude oil to compensate that country for lost exports  caused by earthquake damage, a senior Petroleos de Venezuela  (PDVSA) official said.
"We have yet to finalize details on how the compensation  will be carried out and how OPEC production quotas will be  affected," he said during the signing of a joint venture deal  with Union Pacific Corp today.
Ecuador's oil minister Javier Espinosa was quoted today as  saying Venezuela will export the oil on Ecuador's account and  remit the revenues to Quito.
He said Venezuela's oil would be traded through Ecuadorean  state oil company Cepe, but the PDVSA official said the company  never allows third parties to trade its oil.
