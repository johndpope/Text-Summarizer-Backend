U.S. Exports of edible  groundnuts could fall to 185,000 tonnes in the year to  September 1987 from 248,000 in the same 1986 period, trading  company Tracomin SA said.
It revised its December 1986 forecast that exports would  total 205,000 tonnes, citing low demand, the loss of U.S.  Market share in the two main importing countries, Britain and  the Netherlands, and the sale of nuts intended for export at a  premium in the U.S.
Harvest in  1987 could lead to attractive prices, active trading and the  reappearance of the U.S.A as the world's leading producer of  peanuts," it said.
