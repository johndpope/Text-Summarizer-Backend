&lt;Fletcher Challenge Ltd> (FCL)  Managing Director Hugh Fletcher said he was disappointed that  &lt;Rada Corp Ltd> had decided to sell its shares in &lt;N.Z.
Forest  Products Ltd> (NZFP) to Australia's &lt;Amcor Ltd>.
He said the FCL offer was better  than Amcor's because it would have been made to all NZFP  shareholders, but he gave no further details.
Amcor will acquire Rada's  NZFP stake to add to its existing 11 pct and will seek  statutory approval to increase its holding to 50 pct.
