&lt;Norcen Energy Resources Ltd>,  41 pct owned by &lt;Hees International Corp>, said earnings and  cash flow will improve in 1987, even if oil and gas prices  remain at 1986 levels.
The improvement will result from production increases,  lower taxes and royalties, reduced financing costs and from  operating efficiencies and downsizing put into place during  1986, the company said in the annual report.
"While financial results are far from the previous year's  record levels, it is clear that Norcen has withstood declining  prices and remains financially and operationally strong," Norcen  said.
The company said it is well positioned to capitalize on  profitable opportunities in its core business areas, and will  continue to invest to increase revenue and asset values.
