Consumer prices in the countries of the  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  rose 0.3 pct in February and inflation rose to 2.4 pct  year-on-year, the OECD said in a communique.
The OECD attributed the rise in consumer prices to the  effects of the February 1986 drop in energy prices working  their way out of the index.
Among the leading seven industrial countries, consumer  price inflation was highest in Italy at 4.2 pct, followed by  Canada at 4.0 pct, Britain at 3.9 pct, France at 3.4 pct, the  U.S. At 2.1 pct and West Germany and Japan with negative rates  of 0.5 pct and 1.4 pct respectively.
