China's 1987 cotton output must rise  above the 1986 level of 3.54 mln tonnes or supply will fall  short of increasing demand, the China Daily said.
Output in 1986 fell from 4.15 mln tonnes in 1985 and a  record 6.2 mln in 1984, official figures show.
The China Daily  attributed the decline to several factors, including less  favorable weather conditions and new state measures to restrict  cotton production after the 1984 build-up of stocks.
According to Customs figures, cotton exports rose to  558,089 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 347,026 in 1985.
To increase output quickly, the state will raise by 10 pct  the price it pays for cotton produced above and beyond quota  levels, the newspaper said.
The China Daily said all cotton growing areas in south  China should be maintained, and growing in the north should be  concentrated in Hebei, Shandong, Henan and Xinjiang.
