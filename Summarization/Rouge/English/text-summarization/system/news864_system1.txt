Uganda plans to export roasted coffee to  Europe by the end of 1988, a prominent local businessman said.
A.R.
Sendi said on Sunday that Uganda's Ministry of  Industry supports his plan to build a factory to roast, grind  and pack local coffee for export.
He said the Marketing Ministry has authorised the Coffee  Marketing Board to supply his company &lt;Unipack> with 24,000  tonnes of beans a year for processing and export.
Uganda is the world's fifth largest coffee producer, and  expects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year.
Market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefit  Uganda's economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln  (60 kg) bag export quota assigned to the country under the  latest International Coffee Agreement.
