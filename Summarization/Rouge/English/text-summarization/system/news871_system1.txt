A top U.S. Official said Japan has little  chance of persuading the U.S. to drop threatened trade  sanctions, despite the efforts of a Japanese team that left for  Washington today.
"There are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area,  but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from  important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on  security and political issues," he said.
"The question is whether through cooperative actions between  our governments we can reduce the (trade) imbalance or whether  Congress takes action to reduce it through protectionist  legislation," he said.
