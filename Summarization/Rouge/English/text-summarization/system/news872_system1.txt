A limited Belgian issue of silver Ecu  coins with a face value of five Ecus will go on sale from March  23 at a price of 500 Belgian francs each, a Finance Ministry  spokesman said.
The spokesman told Reuters the price for  these would be fixed just before they go on sale but was likely  to be between 8,500 and 9,000 francs.
At least two mln silver coins and several hundreds of  thousands of the gold coins will be minted, he said.
