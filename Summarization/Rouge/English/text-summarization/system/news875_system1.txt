The National Farmers Union, NFU, remains  concerned about the future ownership of British Sugar despite  last week's decision by the government to block bids from  Italy's Gruppo Ferruzzi and Britain's Tate &amp; Lyle Plc.
The union's sugar beet committee met yesterday to consider  the implications of a government Monopolies and Merger  Commission, MMC, report issued last week.
The Trade and Industry Secretary accepted a recommendation  last week by the MMC that it block a bid by Tate and Lyle for S  and W Berisford Plc and stop Gruppo Ferruzzi buying a majority  of British Sugar, owned by Berisford.
"We are looking again at the  undertakings that we have demanded of existing bidders and  which we would seek of any future bidders," the spokesman said.
