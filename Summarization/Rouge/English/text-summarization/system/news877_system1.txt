The south China province of Guangdong is  importing millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas and  other parts of China because farmers have switched from grain  to more profitable crops, the Peking Review magazine said.
The official magazine said the province's grain area fell  to 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of a  total farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares.
Farmers have switched to cash crops such as sugarcane,  bananas, oranges, papaya and freshwater fish-farming, in part  to supply major consumer markets in Hong Kong and Macao, the  magazine said.
