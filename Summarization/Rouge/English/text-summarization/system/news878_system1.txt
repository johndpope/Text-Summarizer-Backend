The Soviet Union has agreed to supply  Iran with refined oil products in exchange for 100,000 barrels  per day of crude, Iran's national news agency, IRNA, said.
The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet  Union might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said.
Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility  studies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields in  southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union.
Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of  its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf.
