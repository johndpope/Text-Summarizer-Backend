Minister of Mines Patrick Chitambala  confirmed that Zambia had ended copper shipments through South  Africa and announced that its state-run mining company had  closed down its liaison office in the white-ruled republic.
He told the official Times of Zambia newspaper in an  interview the government was diverting all mineral exports  along rail routes to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Beira in  Mozambique.
The Times of Zambia quoted unnamed sources as saying Zambia  exported 100,000 tonnes of copper through Dar es Salaam and  17,000 through Beira in the last quarter of 1986.
Diplomatic  sources in Lusaka had earlier expressed doubts over Zambia's  ability to ship all its copper through Beira and Dar es Salaam  without causing massive bottlenecks at the ports.
