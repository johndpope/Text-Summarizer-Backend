NCR Corp, earlier reporting higher  first quarter profit, said it continues to expect that it will  report record earnings and revenue for all of 1987.
NCR said the increase in first quarter profit resulted from  strong revenue growth, which was particularly strong in Europe  and Pacific marketing groups.
NCR's U.S. dollar value of 1987 first quarter worldwide  incoming orders posted a very substantial gain over the prior  year first quarter, NCR also said without giving specific  figures.
Order growth was broad based across NCR's product  lines, with the greatest growth coming from U.S., it said.
