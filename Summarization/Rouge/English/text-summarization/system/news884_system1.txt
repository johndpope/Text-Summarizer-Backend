Unocal Corp said it told the U.S.  Treasury Department that it will not include fluidized bed  combustion technology, a method for the more efficient burning  of solids, at its Parachute Creek oil shale project in Colorado  due to high costs.
Synthetic  Fuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology at  the oil shale plant.
In return the company would have been  eligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports  from the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contract  from the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said.
Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized  bed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs,  compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs.
Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investment  tax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the project  uneconomical even with government price supports and loan  guarantees, Unocal said.
