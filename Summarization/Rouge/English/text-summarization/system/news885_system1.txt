The Administration asked Congress to  replace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it  into line with international tariff categories, U.S. Trade  Representative Clayton Yeutter said.
Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is  called, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet  the present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they  should pay about the same rates of duties.
He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational  negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.
He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under  the new system, with about half expected to join the system by  January 1988.
