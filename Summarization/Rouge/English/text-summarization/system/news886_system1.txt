The U.S. Agriculture Department said  it will begin charging interest tomorrow on the over 12 mln  dlrs the Department of Transportation, DOT, owes USDA to pay  for its share of the cost of shipping food aid on U.S. vessels.
The two departments are trying to hammer out an accord on  how to fund the increasing share of food aid required to be  shipped on U.S. flag vessels under a 1985 farm bill provision  on cargo preference.
Under the 1985 bill, the percentage of food aid shipments  carried on U.S. vessels was to increase gradually over three  years to 75 pct in 1988 from 50 pct.
