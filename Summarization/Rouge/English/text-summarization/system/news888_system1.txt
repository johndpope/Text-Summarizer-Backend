Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger  will join Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige in fighting  Fujitsu Ltd's &lt;ITSU.T> plan to buy 80 pct of &lt;Fairchild  Semiconductor Corp>, Pentagon officials said.
Commerce Department officials told Reuters yesterday that  Baldrige opposed the planned sale and that the White House  Economic Policy Council will take up the matter within weeks.
The Commerce Department advised the Pentagon recently that  defense objections to two proposed sales -- to an Iranian power  company and the Islamic Republic of Iran News Agency -- were  not valid and the sales of small and medium computers would go  through unless more evidence was presented.
