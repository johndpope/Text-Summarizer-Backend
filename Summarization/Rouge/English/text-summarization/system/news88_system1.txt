U.S. television networks said on  Monday that U.S. forces launched a retaliatory strike against  Iran late Sunday, apparently attacking two Iranian offshore oil  drilling platforms.
U.S. officials had been meeting on a response since Friday  when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a  U.S.-flagged ship.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Saturday the  attack on a U.S.-flagged ship in Kuwaiti waters on Friday was  almost certainly by an Iran Silkworm missile.
