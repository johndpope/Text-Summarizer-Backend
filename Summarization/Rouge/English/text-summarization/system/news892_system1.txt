Canada has threatened to stop imports  of Danish pigmeat from July 14 after Canadian veterinary  inspectors approved only two of 33 slaughterhouses, a Danish  agriculture ministry official told Reuters.
Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an  interview with the daily Berlingske Tidende: "Denmark will not  accept a ban on Danish meat exports, and I am sure we can reach  an understanding with the Canadians with the help of the EC."
Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crowns  in 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Community  totalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs.
Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion  that the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC  veterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.
