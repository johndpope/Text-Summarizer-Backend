West German exports to the United  States fell below four billion marks worth in January for the  first time since mid-1984, provisional Bundesbank data showed.
The figures showed exports were 3.85 billion marks in  January, sharply down from December's 4.40 billion and the  lowest since the 3.56 billion exported to the U.S.
In July  1984.
Total West German exports to Western industrialised  countries also fell in January to 34.76 billion marks from  December's 36.45 billion, also posting the lowest monthly total  since July 1984.
West German exports to the European Community were 21.60  billion marks in January, down from 22.14 billion in December  and 22.94 billion in January last year, the figures showed.
Separately, Commerzbank AG said in a report that the focus  of West German exports this year was likely to shift to Europe  because of an expected downturn in growth in the dollar area.
