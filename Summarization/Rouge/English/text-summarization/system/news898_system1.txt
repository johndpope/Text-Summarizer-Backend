Shares of Polaroid Corp rose following  a reiterated recommendation by Merrill Lynch and Co that  focused on strong earnings momentum for the company, traders  said.
"We have been recommending the stock since it was in the  50s, but we reiterated today because of expectations of strong  earnings momentum, its benefits from the lower dollar and  anticipation of nice gains in margins," Merrill Lynch  analyst Charles Ryan said.
"Polaroid is working overtime on production of cameras and  film, so we expect first quarter earnings to be up about 40  pct," Ryan said, estimating earnings of 70 cts a share in the  first quarter compared to 52 cts a share earned a year earlier.
