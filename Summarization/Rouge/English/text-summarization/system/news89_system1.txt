Venezuela will back Ecuador's bid to  raise its OPEC quota above 221,000 barrels per day (bpd)  because it is a justifiable demand, Venezuelan Energy Minister  Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.
He told reporters the country deserved a higher quota in  compensation for the five months it was forced to suspend oil  production when its main pipeline was destroyed by an  earthquake last March.
