Rates for adjustable-rate mortgages decline eight basis  points from early February to 8.43 pct in early March, the bank  board said.
The average effective interest rate on all loans closed by  major mortgage lenders declined nine basis points from early  February to early March, the agency said.
For fixed-rate loans it was 9.36 pct, 14  basis points below a month earlier, the agency said.
