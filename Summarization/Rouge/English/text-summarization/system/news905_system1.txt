Strong growth in domestic demand was a key  feature of the economies of southern European countries in  1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.
In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's total  domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to  five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth  restrained private consumption.
Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and  domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected  to be halved to five pct next year.
The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply  next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European  Community and declining competitiveness.
