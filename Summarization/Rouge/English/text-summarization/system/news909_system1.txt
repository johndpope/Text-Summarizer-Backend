National Westminster Bank USA said  higher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantial  increase in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise in  first-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reported  a year earlier.
Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at the  end of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrs  of loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status.
The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for  the remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced  by about 4.9 mln dlrs.
