Capitol Bancorp said it expects to  restate its results for 1986 to a loss of about one mln dlrs  due to a reclassification of loans recommended by auditor Ernst  and Whinney.
The company said the restatement also reflects a  substantial increase in reserves of its principal subsidiary,  Capitol Bank and Trust Co.
