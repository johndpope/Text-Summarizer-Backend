Avery Inc said the company will not  show a profit in the next quarter and will probably not show a  profit in 1987.
Speaking at the annual shareholders meeting, chairman  Nelson Peltz declined to estimate when the company would become  profitable.
Peltz said Uniroyal Chemical Co, acquired last year, would  increase Avery's operating earnings but that associated  acquisition costs would prevent Avery from posting net profits  for some time.
In the fiscal year ended May 30, 1986, Avery reported a  loss of 489,000 dlrs.
The increase in common shares would cover, among other  things, the exercise of Triangle Industries Inc's &lt;TRI> and  Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's warrants issued in relation to  Avery's 710 mln dlr acquisition of Uniroyal Chemical late last  year.
