In its World Production and Trade report, the USDA said  sales of French corn for nearby delivery have been confirmed  with an export subsidy of about 145 dlrs per tonne, bringing  the French price to about 72 dlrs per tonne, FOB.
The French sales mark the beginning of commercial EC corn  exports which could reach 750,000 tonnes to North Africa and  the Middle East, areas which have traditionally purchased their  corn needs from the United States, the department said.
