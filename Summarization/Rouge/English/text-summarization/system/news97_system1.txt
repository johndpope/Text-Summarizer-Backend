Pacific Lighting Corp said it is  considering the sale of its land development line of business  and will be initiating discussions with potential buyers.
Alternatives to the sale being considered include a master  limited partnership and an initial public offering of the  equity in the land development companies, it said.
Proceeds from the sale would likely be invested in Pacific  Lightings' new specialty retailing line of business and its oil  and gas operations, the company said.
The investment banking firm Morgan Stanley has been  retained to advise Pacific Lighting on the disposition of the  land development operations.
