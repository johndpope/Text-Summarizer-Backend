Colombia will not attend a meeting of  coffee producing countries scheduled for this weekend in  Nicaragua, Jorge Cadenas, manager of the National Coffee  Growers' Federation, said.
Colombia, Brazil and the Central American coffee producing  countries were invited to the meeting in Managua to analyze the  market situation      However, he did not dismiss the idea of dialogue and  negotiation in preparation for meetings of the International  Coffee Organization.
Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's exporters'  association, speaking to Reuters earlier this week, ruled out a  fresh Colombian initiative on export quotas saying producers  had now to show a common resolve which could emerge from  continuous contacts.
